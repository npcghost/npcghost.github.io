I've unfortunately grown quite a distrust towards healthcare workers. They also take an offense to this so I can't speak up about it unless around other patients. If my coworkers were known to hurt others however I wouldn't blame my clients for feeling the same way. Introspection seems to be an unecessary skill in medicine. 
  
I also think it's both sad and hilarious that they blame the sudden increase of patients from 2020 on tiktok. It reminds me of an out of touch older person with "those damn phones". Tiktok just unfortunately has a bit of a scary algorithm and maybe being dismissed was already a huge problem that found its way on to the platform. I'm sure a global pandemic at the same time causing long term health issues didn't help either. 



### Adverse Medication Guidance

<details><summary>Issues with SSRIs</summary> 


I used to disregard mild side effects, thinking they might be from something else or a placebo effect. But there were instances when it was unmistakable, like with Lexapro. After a few days on it, I experienced constant shaking, sickness, and strange sensations. My sleep patterns were erratic; I'd either fall asleep instantly or feel like I'd been awake all day upon waking.

I called my doctor's office, and they assured me these initial symptoms were normal, suggesting I take the prescribed hydroxyzine alongside it. I tried to ignore the symptoms. However, on the seventh day, I woke up, got ready for work, and suddenly felt a shock up my spine. I lost sensation in my limbs, collapsed, and experienced total paralysis with no breathing or heartbeat. It was a terrifying experience, and I couldn't even scream. After a minute, I regained feeling and hyperventilated.

I called my doctor's office, who advised me to come in without driving. They found elevated vitals and nystagmus but didn't see anything requiring an ER visit. Strangely, my doctor insisted I continue the medication and claimed it was just a placebo in the first month. His reaction left a lasting fear of medication, as I worry there won't be help if something goes wrong. I should have changed doctors, but I hesitated due to the time invested with him and self-doubt about my actions during this incident.
Also he had agreed to do further testing as I felt something was very wrong.

### Malingering Accusations
<details> <summary> Being accused of faking </summary>

I keep my medical records for accurate reference due to my cognitive and memory issues, relying on OCR technology for recall. When I requested records from my physical therapist (PT), I noticed they mentioned my absence between my initial evaluation and the start of therapy, suggesting I might be malingering. They also questioned the validity of my condition, noting that I briefly stood still while they applied straps and then continued to wobble.  
<br>
I could have explained the reasons behind these actions (e.g., delays due to financial issues, surgery, the pandemic, and transportation challenges). Additionally, my blood pressure issue affects my vestibular system, so calf tightening briefly stabilizes me but worsens it when released. But they assumed and documented without asking. I worry that future physicians might side with the PT, dismissing the vailidity of my symptoms due to this written statement. Also should I ever need disability assistance in the future, this likely shattered any possibility even though I had proof against it.   
<br>
I didn't know how to resolve this at the time. Consulting with a psychologist and others, I received mixed advice. Some suggested filing a complaint and correcting it, while others believed the correction might draw more attention and considered it just an opinion. Given the small city and potential system backlash, I hesitated.   
<br>
This casual approach by my PT, especially after I confided in them about the importance of keeping myself employed as I could end up homeless, has left me feeling betrayed. There appeared to be no turmoil between us and she was quite pleasant. The whole situation really messed with my head.

### ER Visit
<details><summary> Only once I've gone to the ER and don't think I will again unless the cause extremely obvious</summary> 
I went to the ER a long time ago because I kept fainting over and over. I was barely conscious and they kept accusing me of drug use while I was too confused and out of it to understand why they were so insistent on me just telling them what I took. When I finally said I smoked weed as a teenager not knowing what they even wanted from me, th Dr lectured me for using it back then and blamed it on that? Wrote on my chart that I am involved in illicit drug use. Then blamed it on the one cup of coffee I had that morning. I tried to show them everytime I stood up, everything would crash but they kept forcing me to lay back down and wouldn't catch it on any monitors. I was drug tested which was clean and they didn't say anything much after that... wheeled into the billing department to discuss my $5k bill as my head kept falling over due to how ill I was, then told to leave. I sat outside continuing to pass out on the sidewalk. Made me feel both worse and better when I found out this was a common thing for patients and even happened to a few others I know of. I won't visit an ER anymore now if I think I'm dying. Urgent care or I'll take my chances if I can't move.

### Proof
<details><summary>screenshots from online forums</summary>
I thought it was something I was doing wrong for a while until I realized this is just what happens when you have these symptoms and no answers.   
Got me a bit curious about why, with all their education, they can assume malice/laziness so confidently. A lot of the patients they mock used to be highly driven, but apparently no one with invisible illnesses suffer the way the healthcare workers do so no one has the right to complain.    <br>
<br>
  
I don't see a way to win this battle. It feels like even a good portion are actively working against their patients. For what reason? 

Another reason I'm not really getting much worked up anymore.
