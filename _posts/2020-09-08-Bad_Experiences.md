### Disbelief of side effects

<details><summary>An event where I was told to keep taking something that harmed me </summary> 


I used to disregard mild side effects, thinking they might be from something else or a placebo effect. But there were instances when it was unmistakable, like with Lexapro. After a few days on it, I experienced constant shaking, sickness, and strange sensations. My sleep patterns were erratic; I'd either fall asleep instantly or feel like I'd been awake all day upon waking.

I called my doctor's office, and they assured me these initial symptoms were normal, suggesting I take the prescribed hydroxyzine alongside it. Trusting my doctor, I tried to ignore the symptoms. However, on the seventh day, I woke up, got ready for work, and suddenly felt a shock up my spine. I lost sensation in my limbs, collapsed, and experienced total paralysis with no breathing or heartbeat. It was a terrifying experience, and I couldn't even scream. After a minute, I regained feeling and hyperventilated.

I called my doctor's office, who advised me to come in without driving. They found elevated vitals and nystagmus but didn't see anything requiring an ER visit. Strangely, my doctor insisted I continue the medication and claimed it was just a placebo in the first month. His reaction left a lasting fear of medication, as I worry there won't be help if something goes wrong. I should have changed doctors, but I hesitated due to the time invested with him and self-doubt about my actions during this incident.
Also he had agreed to do further testing as I felt something was very wrong.

### Malingering Accusations
<details> <summary> Being accused of faking </summary>

I keep my medical records for accurate reference due to my cognitive and memory issues, relying on OCR technology for recall. When I requested records from my physical therapist (PT), I noticed they mentioned my absence between my initial evaluation and the start of therapy, suggesting I might be malingering. They also questioned the validity of my condition, noting that I briefly stood still while they applied straps and then continued to wobble.  
<br>
I could have explained the reasons behind these actions (e.g., delays due to financial issues, surgery, the pandemic, and transportation challenges). Additionally, my blood pressure issue affects my vestibular system, so calf tightening briefly stabilizes me but worsens it when released. Ironically, But they assumed and documented without asking. I worry that future physicians might side with the PT, dismissing my case due to this written statement.  
<br>
I didn't know how to resolve this at the time. Consulting with a psychologist and others, I received mixed advice. Some suggested filing a complaint and correcting it, while others believed the correction might draw more attention and considered it just an opinion. Given the small city and potential system backlash, I hesitated.   
<br>
I've been warned that this incident could harm future attempts at Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) if I become unable to work due to my condition. This casual approach by my PT, especially after I confided in them about the importance of keeping myself employed as I could end up homeless, has left me feeling betrayed. There appeared to be no turmoil between us and she was quite pleasant. The whole situation really messed with my head.

### ER Visit
<details><summary> Only once I've gone to the ER and don't think I will again unless the cause extremely obvious</summary> 
I went to the ER a long time ago because I kept fainting over and over. I was barely conscious and they kept accusing me of drug use while I was too confused and out of it to understand why they were so insistent on me "fessing up". Lectured me for using weed when I was younger and blamed it on that. Wrote on my chart that I am involved in illicit drug use. Then blamed it on the one cup of coffee I had that morning. I tried to show them everytime I stood up, everything would crash but they kept forcing me to lay back down and wouldn't catch it on any monitors. I was drug tested which was clean and they didn't say anything much after that... wheeled into the billing department then told to leave. I sat outside continuing to pass out on the sidewalk. Made me feel both worse and better when I found out this was a common thing for patients and even happened to a few others I know of.

### Proof
<details><summary>screenshots from online forums</summary>
I thought it was something I was doing wrong for a while until I realized this is just what happens when you have these symptoms and no answers.   
Got me a bit curious about why, with all their education, they can assume malice/laziness so confidently. I personally know the symptoms I have are debilitating and very real so how many others are they treating poorly? Apparently a lot.    <br>
There's also quite a few web forums particularly designed to follow patient's social media pages and after reading over these for a long time I've noticed many are healthcare workers themselves. They laugh at and mock the patients even when they die. Constantly following them. Their discussions come up when you search for that patient's alias. Even after their death they continue to follow the patient's families and remark how much happier their family must be without them.  <br>
Funny enough when HCWs get a condition like this themselves it goes one of two ways. It's so mild that they can continue working and double down on their theories that the patients are drama queens, or if they have to quit working, the medical system turns against them. 

Another reason I'm not really getting much worked up anymore.
