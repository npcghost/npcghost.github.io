I have trust issues with healthcare workers due to negative experiences despite my efforts to cooperate. I sought a psychologist for insight, but can't continue due to cost. People do think I'm apathetic, which might influence healthcare workers negatively, though it's unreasonable to expect perfect cheerfulness when I'm ill. Their poor judgements have costed me financially and could negatively effect my care, especially since my medical conditions are hard to prove.  </i> 





### Disbelief of side effects

<details><summary>An event where I was told to keep taking something that harmed me </summary> 


I used to disregard mild side effects, thinking they might be from something else or a placebo effect. But there were instances when it was unmistakable, like with Lexapro. After a few days on it, I experienced constant shaking, sickness, and strange sensations. My sleep patterns were erratic; I'd either fall asleep instantly or feel like I'd been awake all day upon waking.

I called my doctor's office, and they assured me these initial symptoms were normal, suggesting I take the prescribed hydroxyzine alongside it. Trusting my doctor, I tried to ignore the symptoms. However, on the seventh day, I woke up, got ready for work, and suddenly felt a shock up my spine. I lost sensation in my limbs, collapsed, and experienced total paralysis with no breathing or heartbeat. It was a terrifying experience, and I couldn't even scream. After a minute, I regained feeling and hyperventilated.

My boyfriend at the time couldn't help due to work, and I called my doctor's office, who advised me to come in without driving. They found elevated vitals and nystagmus but didn't see anything requiring an ER visit. Strangely, my doctor insisted I continue the medication and claimed it was just a placebo in the first month. His reaction left a lasting fear of medication, as I worry there won't be help if something goes wrong. I should have changed doctors, but I hesitated due to the time invested with him and self-doubt about my actions during this incident.
Also he had agreed to do further testing as I felt something was very wrong.

### Malingering Accusations
<details> <summary> Being accused of faking </summary>

I keep my medical records for accurate reference due to my cognitive and memory issues, relying on OCR technology for recall. When I requested records from my physical therapist (PT), I noticed they mentioned my absence between my initial evaluation and the start of therapy, suggesting I might be malingering. They also questioned the validity of my condition, noting that I briefly stood still while they applied straps and then continued to wobble.  
<br>
I could have explained the reasons behind these actions (e.g., delays due to financial issues, surgery, the pandemic, and transportation challenges). Additionally, my blood pressure issue affects my vestibular system, so calf tightening briefly stabilizes me but worsens it when released. Ironically, But they assumed and documented without asking. I worry that future physicians might side with the PT, dismissing my case due to this written statement.  
<br>
I didn't know how to resolve this at the time. Consulting with a psychologist and others, I received mixed advice. Some suggested filing a complaint and correcting it, while others believed the correction might draw more attention and considered it just an opinion. Given the small city and potential system backlash, I hesitated.   
<br>
I've been warned that this incident could harm future attempts at Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) if I become unable to work due to my condition. This casual approach by my PT, especially after I confided in them about the importance of keeping myself employed as I could end up homeless, has left me feeling betrayed. There appeared to be no turmoil between us and she was quite pleasant. The whole situation really messed with my head.

### Broken promises 
<details><summary> self explanatory </summary> 
I get it, the healthcare system is a mess and only getting worse. I'm not new to promises being broken in my life. But when it's my health it kind of stings more I guess. 
I'm ok with someone admitting not being able to deliver. But it can ruin my entire year or life if you set me up with the expectation and drop it. 
I have to schedule time off work and a ride to leave the city. And the person giving me a ride has to take time off work too. And then the bill I get that's hundreds possibly thousands of dollars. And I collapse daily to make that kind of money. I was referred to a large teaching hospital and was told on the first visit she's going to review my records and try to figure out a solution for me. I honestly worked my ass off saving money for months thinking "she's working on my case". How absolutely stupid and naive of me.  
When I returned I realize she had done none of this and couldn't even ready my chart correctly. I noticed her web searching as we spoke which I don't mind but she landed on a page I had already read and was misinterpreting the article. I'm not sure how she would have reacted to me saying 'I read that' so I asked her if she was sure, and that I thought it was something else. She re-read the page and said oh yes, that's correct. She seemed too distracted eating a sandwhich and was in a rush for some reason.     
After the appointment, I cried. I spent months pulling overtime for this, being so hopeful. Moments later I saw her leaving and going across the street to get another sandwhich.

## Proof
<details><summary>screenshots from online forums</summary>
I thought it was something I was doing wrong for a while until I realized this is just what happens when you have these symptoms and no answers.   
Got me a bit curious about why, with all their education, they can assume malice/laziness so confidently. I personally know the symptoms I have are debilitating and very real so how many others are they treating poorly? Apparently a lot.   
There's also quite a few web forums particularly designed to follow patient's social media pages and after reading over these for a long time I've noticed many are healthcare workers themselves. They laugh at and mock the patients even when they die. Constantly following them. Their discussions come up when you search for that patient's alias. Even after their death they continue to follow the patient's families and remark how much happier their family must be without them.  
Funny enough when HCWs get a condition like this themselves it goes one of two ways. It's so mild that they can continue working and double down on their theories that the patients are drama queens, or if they have to quit working, the medical system turns against them. 

Another reason I'm not really getting much worked up anymore.
