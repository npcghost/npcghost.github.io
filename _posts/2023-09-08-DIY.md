### TVNS (Vagus Nerve Stimulataion) 
alternative to gammacore    
Warning: will attempt to reset fight/flight to rest/digest (imagine heart rate, bp, stomach, etc..)   
Make sure the TENS machine isn't already activated on the top dial before starting. Should hear/feel a click when it turns off/on. 
-acquire ear clips for TENS
-apply left regular tens pad on black lead on black shoulder to ground yourself
-red wire connects to ear clip, place on left ear tragus or concha cavum
Only need one port 
  
**Mode**: normal  
**Pulse width**: 200

roll the dial on the corresponding port to increase intensity and keep it on the least noticeable dial setting

### Abdominal pain
 
I use both ports for this and stick both the red charged sides on the front in the areas of pain and the black ones on the back across from the corresponding red ones. Others have also found success laying it vertical from each pos along the front. 

**Mode**: I use burst but you can use normal too. I prefer burst since it's random.  
**Pulse width**: also up to you. I started at 50  
**Counter**: 15 to 30min
