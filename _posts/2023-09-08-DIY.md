### TVNS (Vagus Nerve Stimulataion) 
alternative to gammacore    
Warning: will attempt to reset fight/flight to rest/digest (imagine heart rate, bp, stomach, etc..)   
Make sure the TENS machine isn't already activated on the top dial before starting. Should hear/feel a click when it turns off/on. 
-acquire ear clips for TENS
-apply left regular tens pad on black lead on black shoulder to ground yourself
-red wire connects to ear clip, place on left ear tragus or concha cavum
Only need one port 
  
**Mode**: normal  
**Pulse width**: 200  
**Counter**: 15min  
  
  <br>
roll the dial on the corresponding port to increase intensity and keep it on the least noticeable dial setting

### Abdominal pain
 
I use both ports for this and stick both the red charged sides on the front in the areas of pain and the black ones on the back across from the corresponding red ones. Others have also found success laying it vertical from each pos along the front. 

**Mode**: I use burst but you can use normal too. I prefer burst since it's random.  
**Pulse width**: also up to you. I started at 50  
**Counter**: 15 to 30min

# Current things I can test at home: 



## Glucose Monitor
Blood sugar levels (helps monitor for diabetes, hypoglycemia, and overall metabolic health)
###  Blood Pressure Monitor
Blood pressure (can help detect hypertension or hypotension)
### Pulse Oximeter
Oxygen saturation levels (helps monitor respiratory function and can indicate anemia or lung conditions)
Heart rate (can indicate arrhythmias, tachycardia, or bradycardia)
### Kardia 6L ECG
Heart rhythm (detects arrhythmias, bradycardia, tachycardia, or irregular heartbeats)
Heart rate (detects variations that might indicate cardiovascular issues)
###  pH Strips
Urine pH (can help detect issues like kidney stones, dehydration, or metabolic disorders)
Saliva pH (can be used to assess digestive health or systemic conditions like acid reflux)
###  COVID Rapid Tests
COVID-19 infection (test for the presence of the virus, can confirm active infection)
###  Thermometer
Body temperature (detects fever, which is indicative of infection or inflammation)


###  Microscope

#### Bacterial Infections
Gram-positive bacteria:

-Streptococcus species (e.g., Streptococcus pyogenes, which causes strep throat, or Streptococcus pneumoniae, which causes pneumonia)    
-Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA, which causes skin infections, abscesses, and sometimes more serious infections like sepsis)    
-Enterococcus species (can cause urinary tract infections, endocarditis)    
-Clostridium species (e.g., Clostridium difficile, which causes diarrhea and colitis)    
-Listeria monocytogenes (can cause food poisoning and infections in pregnant women)


 Gram-negative bacteria:

-Escherichia coli (E. coli) (causes urinary tract infections, gastroenteritis)    
-Pseudomonas aeruginosa (can cause infections in the lungs, skin, and urinary tract, often in immunocompromised individuals)    
-Neisseria gonorrhoeae (causes gonorrhea)    
-Klebsiella pneumoniae (causes pneumonia, urinary tract infections)    
-Haemophilus influenzae (causes respiratory infections, including pneumonia and meningitis)    
-Salmonella species (causes food poisoning and gastroenteritis)    
-Proteus species (can cause urinary tract infections, wounds, and bloodstream infections)    
-Bacterial vaginosis (BV):
Caused by an imbalance of anaerobic bacteria (like Gardnerella vaginalis) in the vagina. It can sometimes be seen as clue cells under the microscope.    
-Tuberculosis (Mycobacterium tuberculosis):
Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) stain can detect the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), though this is more challenging without special equipment.    

####  Fungal Infections
-Candida species (e.g., Candida albicans):
Causes yeast infections (oral thrush, vaginal yeast infections, skin infections).
Can be observed under the microscope with Gram stain or KOH (potassium hydroxide) mount, showing budding yeast cells and pseudohyphae.   
-Aspergillus species:
Common fungal infection, especially in the lungs of immunocompromised individuals.
Seen with special staining (e.g., Gomori's methenamine silver stain), though regular Gram staining can sometimes show branching hyphae.  
-Dermatophytes (causes ringworm and athlete’s foot): 
Can be observed using KOH preparation, showing hyphae and spores in skin or nail scrapings.
   
####  Parasitic Infections (difficult but possible to detect with a microscope)   

-Trichomonas vaginalis:
Causes trichomoniasis, a sexually transmitted infection. It appears as motile, flagellated organisms under the microscope in vaginal or urethral discharge.  
-Giardia lamblia:
Causes giardiasis, an intestinal infection. Can be seen as tear-drop-shaped protozoa in stool samples, though this is less common without a centrifuge. 
-Entamoeba histolytica:
Causes amoebic dysentery. Seen as trophozoites or cysts in stool samples.   
-Toxoplasma gondii:
Can cause toxoplasmosis (especially dangerous in pregnant women). It’s harder to identify with standard stains unless there are tissue cysts, which can sometimes be seen.   


####  Vaginal Infections (using Gram stain)
-Bacterial Vaginosis (BV):
Imbalance of bacteria in the vagina, often seen with clue cells (vaginal epithelial cells covered with bacteria).   
-Gardnerella vaginalis is typically implicated.
Yeast Infections (Candida):
Budding yeast cells and pseudohyphae are indicative of a yeast infection.   
-Trichomoniasis:
Trichomonas vaginalis can be observed as motile protozoa in vaginal or urethral discharge.


####  Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)
E. coli (most common causative agent) and other Gram-negative bacteria like Proteus, Klebsiella, and Pseudomonas.
Look for bacteria, white blood cells, and possibly red blood cells in urine samples under the microscope.    


####  Inflammatory and Other Health Conditions
Increased white blood cells (WBCs) in urine or blood can indicate infection or inflammation, and certain types of neutrophils or lymphocytes can suggest bacterial vs. viral causes.

Red blood cells (RBCs) can indicate hematuria (blood in the urine), potentially caused by infections (e.g., UTIs, kidney stones) or other conditions.
