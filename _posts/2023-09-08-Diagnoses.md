I know these are shit diagnoses. I haven't found an objective answer so I get trash labels slapped on me.  


### Vasovagal Syncope
<details>
Diagnosed when I kept fainting. I always thought this condition was fainging over a common fear trigger like sight of blood, needles, etc. When faced with a fear I do not pass out. These events happened spontaniously. Sometimes after a meal, temp changes, infections, digestive issues. These were pretty intense to me as I'd feel overwhelming pain and eventually my legs would go paralyzed, I'd go deaf and blind,... sometimes crawling around while losing consciousness over and over again. I'd go into convulsions while passed out. A few times others said my lips and eyelids turned blue. I suppose that still puts me in the same category as fainting over the sight of blood. Perhaps the mechanism is the same but I hated never knowing why mine were so particularly bad.

### Depression
<details>
They gave me this required survey thing with questionnaires that didn't make much sense to me since a lot of the answers could be misconstrued with being ill. Like not socializing much, having little energy. But I suppose that led to my depression diagnosis. Ha

### GAD
<details>
I will admit that ever since I got sick I've been constantly in a state of worry and fear. My mind automatically equates being vulnereable to being open for abuse. Also it's uncomfortable to think about how you're supposed to survive the rest of your life sick.

### Vestibular Migraines
<details>
This was an odd one. I started getting vertigo attacks years after my autonomic issues. These things are the most debilitating and horrifying attacks ever to me. On my worst attack, I couldn't move for 20hrs and for another 15hrs I was crawling and bedridden. The room wouldn't stop spinning and I "blacked out" psychologically several times from being so overwhelmed. Yeah that also means laying in your own excrements...   
 After this I had several similar but shorter attacks. Ruled out BPPV. They diagnosed me with menieres but retracted it when my hearing came back fine. I wanted to try the steroid shots so I was bummed that I'd have to prove meniere's before being able to try this. 
Eventually the diagnosis of Vestibular Migraines was reached. 
I haven't had a 30+hr attack but will often still have the hour long ones. Whatever anyone wants to call it, they are the worst thing in my life right now.

### Panic Attacks 
<details>
I was just starting to get my fainting under control when the vertigo started. I lost my mind over this. I started getting panic attacks. I have some times in my life where these are controlled but as of lately they've returned pretty badly. They are back to back also.  
</details>


### POTS
<details>
This was diagnosed kind of late for me. I actually mentioned this over a decade ago to a doctor about my syncope issues and was told it's too rare so I dropped it. I feel like it's more under control now but I think maybe my dr just wanted to be able to open the ability for me to try a particular medication that could help my low blood pressure.

### CFS
<details>
This one is pretty common now too I suppose. I have moments where I can barely keep myself upright. I feel sick - like I've been poisoned and it's caused me to collapse from weakness countless times. Quite alarming when it happens, like your body is just shutting down from being poisoned. It does seem to occur when I've exercised too hard or have 'done too much'. Usually occurs the following days after the events. There's a type of fatigue you feel while sick with the virus I can try to equate this to. Some months I'll get a break from it and other months, it's like every damn day.

I have somewhat significant GI issues I also haven't investigated yet. They're debilitating and kind of tie in with the whole POTS/CFS/dysautonomia BS I suppose. Yet I feel like I will just be trading thousands of dollars for another dead end answer. I'll have to wait until I have better insurance, the symptoms are less vague, or I end up underweight from it.
