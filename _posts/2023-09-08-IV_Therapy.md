I sought after an IV therapy clinic that recently opened nearby. This is a controversial treatment for autonomic issues but I wanted to at least try it and see how much of a difference it would make.     

At first I couldn't even get an appointment in until a week after trying and then it was canceled and postponed another two days by them so trying to get it set up for the height of symptoms or prevention seemed to not be in my favor.  

I also had requested the package that contains pms and illness alleviation as I was recovering from a viral infection and still feeling like shit. I think it had extra magnesium and anti-inflammatories. Unfortunately they just gave me a standard myers cocktail. Perhaps if this all had been done correctly I may have experienced relief. I was a bit nervous about large amounts of NSAIDs however and its effects on my GI system so I suppose it could have gone south anyways.    

   
  
Unfortunately nothing much was felt besides increased hydration. I even woke up with a headache the next day.   
   
I hope to possibly use them in the event of an intense painful migraine attack as they have toradol and zofran, but if it takes them over a week to get to me I see no point. Maybe I could have someone drive me there.
