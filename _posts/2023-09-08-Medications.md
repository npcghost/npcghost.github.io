I seem to already be predispositioned to issues with medications. 


![pharma summary](/assets/img/pharmacogenomic.png)

<a href="https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs4244285">  Especially to medications that use Cyp2c19 (A,A)  
</a>
High amount of studies + rare in N. America (common in Asia 30%?)  
Nonetheless I've been told to not put much weight in these studies from quite a few medical professionals so I suppose it's all just my hypothetical ramblings. 

*disclaimer: this is just one of many variants that could effect metabolism of medications that use cyp2c19.*

## Medications I've tried
<i>
YMMV . My current set of issues can influence how medications affect me much differently than someone with a different set of symptoms. Poor drug metabolism is also a factor here. I am also aware that some of these effects can be attributed to the 'nocebo' or 'placebo' effect, and they can even be influenced by what you ate that day. However, the side effects I experienced or assumed were so strong at times that I am wary about trying it again and have a fear of medications. Obviously I still tried as the list below shows. Also I've never had the ability to take more than a few days away from work so I often had to stop treatment if I couldn't be bedridden for very long.  </i>
 

### Benadryl  
occasionally very sick next day , flu like symptoms 
<details><summary>info</summary>
My Dr at the time had told me it's ok to use this nightly as a sleep aid but I eventually realized it was dramatically increasing my symptoms so I stoppped. 
</details>
    
<br> 

### Meclizine  
Have sublingual tabs that reduce about 20%, definitely not great for severe attacks, the pills don't seem to be as effective either
<details><summary>info</summary> These can work pretty fast and more efficiently than the pills   <br>

</details> <br> 


### Hydroxyzine  
These do seem to make me drowsy, and reduce some anxiety, but it causes an increase in attacks if I take it too often. 
<details><summary>info</summary> It's technically an antihistamine but has anti anxiety properties for some patients. I actually took it briefly many years ago and it made me feel really weird. This time around I tried it again and it seemed to work better. 10mg is often all that's needed to get drowsy but during an attack I may take upwards of 50 to 75mg. I think 100 is the max but can still extend beyond that. For a while I was taking it all day during a bad attack (like 10mg every hour until I was calm again) and I think it was causing substantially increased rebound anxiety as it wore off. It does seem to dramatically reduce my blood pressure and heart rate. I already have issues with hypotension so lowering it more also may have been causing increased anxiety. I would usually sleep on it, but the after effects still had that vital lowering effect for a whole day after.  
</details> <br> 
 


### Dimenhydrinate   
Mild sedative even in larger doses for me, increases symptoms 
<details><summary>info</summary> These are often sold as dramamine. I always got carsick so that mixed with my autonomic issues at the time made long trips terrible. I decided to keep it on me during a recent trip just in case. 5hr car ride, -10f, little sleep and we made it to the hotel. I took an elevator up 8 floors to my room. The elevator sensation never stopped for me. Constant falling sensation. I took a dramamine, tried to ignore it, and went back down the elevator to have dinner. Middle of dinner I felt like I was going to faint. Tried to escape but didn't make it and fainted in front of the entire restaurant. Caused a scene since I went into convulsions. EMT called. Spent rest of my vacation in my room vomiting. Thank you dramamine.    
Theoretically now I assume my blood pressure was low and it dropped it even lower making me highly susceptible to fainting. I was still quite new to my issues at the time.  
</details> <br> 



### Doxylamine succinate  
Effective sleeping medicine, fast tolerance, mild hangover effect 
<details><summary>info</summary> I notice these are one of the few otc sleeping pills I can somewhat handle. I noticed this when I realized I could handle nyquil fine and this is a main ingredient. It seems like unisom is the main manufacturer of this. I prefer to have a liquid version since I don't like taking even a small amount more than I should, just enough to drift to sleep. I don't know what the long term consequences are of these in particular. Cholinergics theoretically linked to dementia. But I also know without sleep, I lose my job and my mind.    
</details> <br> 


### Betahistine    
Increased GI issues, mild relief of vertigo
<details><summary>info</summary> This was suggested to me by others with similar issues. It appears to be commonly prescribed in other countries for vertigo but not approved in the states. I took other totally very legal means of acquiring this to try it.   
I started with half a dose but it didn't seem to do anything so gradually increased to full dose. It did seem to almost dull the sensation of vertigo a bit. Like it was holding the middle ear down with static. But just barely and the GI symptoms I had from it didn't go away with time. It also can counteract some antihistamines which I rely on occasionally so it was not worth it to me.  
</details> <br> 

	
### Ondansetron  
Causes a headache, but effective anti nausea med. 
<details><summary>info</summary>  
</details> <br> 

	
### Acetaminophen  
No obvious side effects, but also very low efficacy
<details><summary>info</summary> Since this is low efficacy and it's rare for me to have a fever, I usually don't take this very often. Alternative if you have issues with NSAIDs so I'm trying to not ruin my gut on NSAIDs to begin with so I don't have only this to rely on. 
</details> <br> 



### Ibuprofen  
GI issues if too often, but effective pain relief
<details><summary>info</summary> This is actually pretty decent for pain in most cases, although I've had it not come through for me in rare moments. Caution does need to be exercised with this, however, as it reduces the mucus you generate in your stomach, hence the advice to eat with it. I do my best to stay at 200mg, only taking it if my pain is so bad that I can't work, sleep, or am fainting... and not more than a few days in a row. Rebound occurs anyway      
</details> <br> 
 
  
### Naproxen  
Tried for cramps, headaches, muscle aches. Doesn't work?
<details><summary>info</summary> I honestly haven't figured out what this even helps with so far. It's another NSAID too so definitely not worth it for me. 
</details> <br> 
 
	
### CBD	
Occasionally works for pain and anxiety, but often not at all.  
<details><summary>info</summary> THC increases my vertigo (sad days) but it seems like a little bit is needed for CBD to be more pronounced. Still seems too low at the federal limit anyways. I've tried various reputable oils and balms. Very hit or miss. I wonder if I just don't metabolize it most of the time. Sometimes it works great. Since there's practically no issues with safety I always give it a shot to see if it will work for something mild. 
</details> <br> 
 
	
### Propranolol	  
Made my BP crash; caused more anxiety   
<details><summary>info</summary> I already have issues with low BP so this wasn't a good mix. I went in prepared for that though so maybe I was setting myself up to fail. I even tried it for performance anxiety. It's supposed to stop all your physical symptoms. It kind of did... but not mentally, then I fainted. 

</details> <br> 
 
	
	
### Topamax   
Daily panic attacks first week, was told to stop it  
<details><summary>info</summary> I really wanted this to work. At the time I was desparate and just wanted something to work. I was in a state of constant high anxiety and panic. I would just sit on the floor shaking, sweating, delerious. and my boyfriend at the time told me I probably should stop them but I was determined to "get used to it". I called my new Dr at the time and he told me to stop them. Since I felt so awful it was hard to argue with that but I wonder why he would tell me to stop over something like that when my last doctor got mad that I wanted to stop over sudden paralysis? Wild 
</details> <br> 

	

### Progesterone  
Cream and pill ; dramatically increased vertigo, couldn't stick with it 
<details><summary>info</summary> Really wanted this to work. Severe attacks almost always have occured during hormonal shifts within my cycle. I couldn't handle it anymore. Even the smallest spike sent me into a cluster of attacks. Maybe I'll try this when I'm a bit older as hormonal balances change often.  
</details> <br> 



### Depo  
Bled for 8 months straight, increase in all symptoms, almost lost job
<details><summary>info</summary> I remember long ago getting on this hoping it would stop my period but instead it made me sick for months and my period never stopped. I called the office about this and they told me 'just give it more time'. I didn't continue the series as I would have been homeless without an income. If it got any worse I would have had to stop working.    
</details> <br> 

	
	
### Azithromycin  
Temporarily stopped all symptoms for 2 weeks, gradual return to baseline 
<details><summary>info</summary> I was actually pretty nervous to take this but within 3hrs all of my symptoms disappeared. It stayed like this until 2 weeks after the last dose. One of the first 'this can't be a placebo' moments I've ever had because it was like a heavy fog had lifted from me and I had never felt that clear headed since before I got sick.  
I've told multiple doctors about this and most just give it the eyebrow raise and continue with stanadard treatment layout.  
I was given another round by my pcp however but it wasn't as effective I assume since it was less than a year from my last dose. Also would like to avoid constant abx use for obvious reasons.  
</details> <br> 



### Cipro  
Intense joint pains and increased fever  
<details><summary>info</summary> This was a long time ago so it's hard to accurately document what happened. Back when I used to just take what's given to me without hesitation or question. I remember not being able to finish it and it costing me more days from work as it made me even more sick and immobile with joint pain. I probably should have finished it, I remember I had like 2 left and really needed to get back to work.   
</details> <br> 



### Metronidazole  
Kept throwing up the pills, high amounts of abdominal pain
<details><summary>info</summary> Little embarrassed about why I had to take this but what it was resolving just wasn't worth the pain. Made all my symptoms worse. 
</details> <br> 
 
	
### Escitalopram  
Sudden complete paralysis and intense fear, stomach problems, fever, sweating, diarhhea, trembling
<details><summary>info</summary> This was  the worst reaction I've ever had to any substance ever.
 I'm not convinced this was nocebo at all in the slightest. This was a gradual worsening until the attack. I'm not sure why. Either it's because I can't excrete it and it builds up then releases in my blood stream all at once.. or it caused my already low electrolytes to bottom out. Dr at the time was upset I didn't want to continue. 
 
 
</details> <br> 


	
	
### Amitryptiline   
Can't handle doses over 25mg but will hit tolerance and just have to stop, helps sleep and appetite,
<details><summary>info</summary> I was actually on this for a long time. The side effects were mild and some actually beneficial. It did nothing for my vertigo and slightly even increased positional tachycardia but I was sleeping 12hrs a day, barely awake when I was up, and eating more. Before I started it, I was sleep deprived and having issues keeping food down. I also liked not being conscious.. a lot. I remember I was not doing a good job at work and didn't even care. I hit tolerance but started getting headaches if I increased my dose past 25mg. So I had to stop them. Might return someday since tolerance is reset. It's a good medication to kind of stop me from losing my mind. 
</details> <br> 

  
	
	
	
### Albuterol 
No issues. I don't use this unless I feel like I'm dying
<details><summary>info</summary> After a respiratory illness I was having issues waking up feeling like my diaphragm was paralyzed and not being able to take a breath for a minute before finally catching my breath. I was told to try PPIs even though I felt no heartburn. I requested an inhaler should it happen again and it did help a bit. I only use it during respriratory infections now. 
</details> <br> 
 

  
	
### Omeprazole  
Back pain, increased abdominal issues  
<details><summary>info</summary> I tried these for a bit but they didn't help my shortness of breath attacks much plus added new problems.  
</details> <br> 



	
### Hydrocodone  
Effective pain reliever, only used once
<details><summary>info</summary> I forgot when I last tried this but remember it working really well. I've also had oxy and much prefer this instead. 
</details> <br> 

   

### Codeine   
Effective pain reliever, haven't tried since childhood
 <details><summary>info</summary> Still better than oxy 
</details> <br> 

  


### Oxycontin  
Causes vertigo to increase, motion sickness, mild pain relief   
<details><summary>info</summary> add text
</details> <br> 




### Tramadol  
Very sick - fever, sweating  
<details><summary>info</summary> Forgot when I tried this also, was before I started logging things so at least a few decades. 
</details> <br> 


	
### Piracetam  
<i>yes I mean piracetam and not paracetamol. </i>
Debilitating long brain zaps    
<details><summary>info</summary> Was kind of winging experimental medications when I first got sick and thought this would help my fatigue and brain fog. It didn't seem to do anything beneficial and started giving me very long brain zaps. I still remember one that lasted 10 minutes straight. I thought I was going to drift into a seizure.  
</details> <br> 
  

   
### Magnesium  
Mild side effects, causes headaches, effective laxative 
<details><summary>info</summary> tried a variation of these. Citrate, glycinate, threonate.. all seem to just give me a headache. It's a bit calming and of course laxative effects but overall not worth it. I've never tested my mag levels and not sure if that's even an accurate test but I wonder if I possibly have.. too much? 
</details> <br> 

  
	
	
### Tanganil   
no side effects, unsure if useful <details><summary>info</summary> This also doesn't appear to be available in the states so I got this from very legal means as well. No side effects, but not effects of any kind either. 
It's supposed to help both hypotensions and central vertigo/balance issues so I was really hoping this would be a match. 
</details> 
<br> 
  

### Prochlorperazine 	
Increased anxiety 	

<details><summary>info</summary> I only took this once but it seemed to speed my heart up and caused my adrenaline system to spike. Could this have just been anxiety? Hard to tell.. scared to try it again but maybe I should. 
</details> <br> 
      
	
### coq10  
heart palpitations 
<details><summary>info</summary> increased palpitations when I took them hoping to reduce them. Not sure what it would do now that I'm not having constant palp issues. 
</details> <br> 



### Famotidine  
helps tachycardia and air hunger  
<details><summary>info</summary> Seems to greatly benefit shortness of breath and overall that flushed/adrenaline feeling. Realized later this often is used for mcas symptoms https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8021898/
Also apparentlly a lot of people with ALDH2 deficiencies take this to avoid skin flushing with alcohol. 
</details> <br> 



	
### Probiotics  
Didn't work at first but then relieved a post viral gi issues I acquired. Certain kinds cause headaches. 
<details><summary>info</summary> Early 2023 I was down with a virus of some sort. When I recovered I had.. some really interesting/embarrassing gi issues that kept me confined near a bathroom at all times. This didn't stop for a month and I ordered visbiome. Within 3 days I regained control of everything. Not only that but after a few weeks my gi issues were better than before I started it. When I try to taper down it returns however.  
</details> <br> 

	
	
	
### l theanine   
good for jitters, often combined with coffee. Doesn't seem to help vertigo much   
<details><summary>info</summary> add text
</details> <br> 
 
### NAC
Caused shortness of breath, may try again with molybdenum since the air hunger could be a result of sulfur buildup. 
	
	
### LDN  
headaches, fatigue   
<details><summary>info</summary> Seemed promising, especially with my recent antibotic response. High safety profile, tons of people improving on it. Its use in areas outside of addiction is still novel and I wasn't sure if I could get a dr to agree to such an odd thing. I found out ageless rx offers it with barely a consult so I went with them. There are other totally legal methods too. I also completely forgot I have friends that are always in rehab and they all have a ton they probably don't take. Somehow got on to my medical record that I take this. I don't like that because many HCW may take this the wrong way and think I've been in addiction treatment.   

If you are using the 50mg pills you can dissolve in distilled water in a ratio that's easy to section into the dosages you need then just do a stir of it before taking it daily. 

I started at .25 then gradually moved to 1mg a day but for months my headaches, myalgia, fatigue just got worse.

### Phenibut  
This was supposed to help vertigo and social anxiety, but it made everything so much worse.  
<details><summary>info</summary> I've always noted to take special caution with any medications directly targeting gaba/dopamine. This is such a controversial drug. Unregulated gaba type drug from Russia. High potential for abuse and addiction occurs faster than Benzodiazepines. Similar withdrawals. 
Technically still legal but its poor reputation has caused most vendors to stop selling it. I think I got mine from liftmode recently which has had QC issues but there's not really a better vendor it seems.  


</details> <br> 




### Midodrine  
Felt tingly but didn't seem to mess with my BP or heart rate by much. It works for like 30min and I can do chores without getting lightheaded, then for 4hrs I feel worse than before I took it.  
<details><summary>info</summary> Supposed to help with hypotension. 
</details> <br> 



### Lorazepam 
I don't "feel" anything. When I confront something that causes vertigo or panic, it seems to stop it? Perhaps I need to do a test and have someone give me a real one and then a sugar pill occasionally and then chart my results. I also realize delusions of sobriety is a thing with this but I doubt I would ever reach that on such low doses.   
I do have issues standing at a counter 100% of the time and it was so incredible to stand there without any PPPD.  

I already am fully aware of the consequences the come with daily use. This is just a rescue med for me.  

<details><summary>More details</summary> Took a lot out of me to ask for this and I am now scared to ask for more. All my previous doctors didn't seem to want to prescribe it. My attacks can be back to back and last all day. To a point I can't move or have to crawl. There seems to be very high success with this drug stopping that. It would not only stop the attack but prevent them from being disabled for weeks later since the length of the attack affects recovery. I'd say upwards of 90% of patients were able to escape terrible consequences of vertigo attacks with this. The vestibular patients really encouraged I try to get this. And that yes I risk being labeled as drug seeking unfortunately.    
   
It was really upsetting to me that many were just denied this. That you can lose your job, your house, your family, everything all because no one wanted to trust you with a particular medication.   


That being said, I am so grateful my Dr trusts me with this.
