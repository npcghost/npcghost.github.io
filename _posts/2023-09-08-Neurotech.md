A person of interest I've been following in particular has been Nita Farahany that often demonstrates/discusses various types of neurotech being introduced into government/corporations.    

Often matters of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havana_syndrome"> Havana Syndrome </a> and the ability for devices to be used to transmit feelings into users comes into discussions. It has been recently demonstrated that while we are still in primitive development, vertigo appears to be one of the most basic types of feelings that can be transmitted via brainwave. Supposedly there is huge debate on if a very large amount of people can be targeted by this with many scientists claiming such a thing couldn't exist. But proof it can be done on an individual direct level at least. Is it wild/outlandish to consider certain waves are causing vestibular issues within certain patients? Especially since we all have brainwaves that are unique enough to be used for biometrics? Surely that could mean some of us are particularly prone to certain wave/frequencies. I don't think outright dismissing this theory as comical is the best approach as it appears to carry some merit.

I realize the following is highly unethical, WEF is terrible, etc etc,... but from a Vestibular standpoint it would be beneficial to investigate this.
