Due to the various issues below, I'm unable to drive. I've definitely tried until my brain just shuts down from the stress of the symptoms and I hit a curb. Many HCW still encouraged me to keep driving...



### Cardiovascular Symptoms:

Fainting episodes (usually precipitated by gastro pain or malaise)   
Positional Tachycardia (managed) 
Low blood pressure (managed)


### Menstrual Symptoms:

Heavy and painful periods  
Interference of menstrual symptoms with other health issues  
Used to faint from pain repetitively but this is becoming a less common occurence 


### Gastrointestinal Symptoms:

Digestive issues (constipation, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting)  
Bleeding  
Incontinence (no longer an issue)    
Always feeling multiple symptoms hour before BM  

### Neurological Symptoms:

Vertigo attacks (including rare intense ones and daily rocking motions) <i> this is my most debilitating symptom</i>  
Migraine auras affecting object perception  


### Psychological Symptoms:  
panic attacks  
dpdr   
social anxiety  
the usual 'everyone has them' flavors (anxiety and depression)  
Insomnia 


### Misc? 

Post-exertional fatigue and flu-like malaise. Poisoned feeling. 


## Symptoms I no longer have
Severe headaches (16-20)
Chronic palpitations (20-24) I'd get these daily and they would always take my breath away, some days leaving me bedridden if it was every few seconds. I was told it was probably anxiety from an urgent care. They stopped when I had my wisdom teeth removed....
