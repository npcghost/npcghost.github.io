# Tests completed

## VNG and caloric
conclusion of central vertigo

Couldn't finish Caloric but this appears to be common with migraine related vertigo Neuro-otological findings in patients with migraine- and nonmigraine-related dizziness? 
<details> side note, caloric caused a massive vertigo attack and I started sweating and shaking so she stopped the test and told me I really don't have to do it so I was like ok sure why suffer for nothing, then she noted that I was unable to complete it due to anxiety. Had I known she would have noted it this way I would have just told her to start over again <br>

## EEG 
(it was like an hr, a month after a major but brief paralysis attack). Nothing remarkable

## MRI 
only white matter hyperintensities apparently not a cause of concern and etiology still a medical debate 


<details>
Indication:SYNCOPE AND COLLAPSE 

Technique: Sagittal T1, axial T1, axial T2, axial FLAIR, coronal FLAIR, axial and coronal T1 postcontrast, diffusion and ADC map were obtained. The examination was performed before and after injection of 5.5 mL of Gadavist. 

Findings: 
Few tiny foci of T2 hyperintensity in bilateral frontal deep white matter represent nonspecific gliosis and of doubtful clinical significance. Dilated perivascular space in the right lentiform nucleus is a normal variant. No intracranial space-occupying lesions or abnormal enhancement. The craniocervical junction is unremarkable. No intracranial hemorrhage. No hydrocephalus. No midline shift. No evidence of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarction. The visualized intracranial flow-voids appear grossly unremarkable. Minimal mucosal thickening is seen in the anterior ethmoid air cells, the remaining visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells bilaterally are essentially well-aerated. 

Impression: 
Essentially unremarkable brain MRI without and with contrast.

## Loop recorder
didn't catch anything. I'd get a bill for every manual record I pressed so it was difficult to capture these as I would second guess myself and it would be too late if I finally fainted. But I did faint a few times and nothing got automatically triggered. Very confused about this 
They also told me there's no way it's dead already as they would have been notified first and I had to go there and they confirmed it was dead.   I can't afford to remove it...

## Various Blood tests
Several blood tests over the years and the only odd thing has been isolated b6 deficiency (meaning other b vitamins were normal) which is rare. Could be due to malabsorption of some sort?   
Also I tried quite a few times to get hormonal panels done with the gyn and was denied so I gave up. It costed money and pto just to ask.

## Home monitoring devices
-Glucose has been caught multiple times in hypoglycemia levels (with symptoms) hours after carbs. Conclusive of reactive hypoglycemia.  
-Blood pressure has been taken moments before loss of consciousness showing remarkably low. Heart rate rises them plummets sharply vice versa  
-o2 has been consistently well even during times of shortness of breath. This only goes low during respriratory illnesses, understandably.   
-Temp appears challenging to accurately capture. Under the tongue and against temple is almost always 96 but that seems too low. Clinically I run around 98.   
-6L ECG rarely shows anything outside of benign pvcs

# Tests to be done:

### VEMP

### Colonoscopy

### CT specifically for SCDS 
(this may be impossible to get in my city and I can't drive)
