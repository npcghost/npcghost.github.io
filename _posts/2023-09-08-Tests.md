## VNG and caloric
conclusion of central vertigo

Couldn't finish Caloric but this <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18057875/">  appears to be common with migraine related vertigo </a>
 
<details> side note, caloric caused a massive vertigo attack and I started sweating and shaking so she stopped the test and told me I really don't have to do it so I was like ok sure why suffer for nothing, then she noted that I was unable to complete it due to anxiety. She then told me I should not have been that sensitive to the test. Had I known she would have noted it this way and assumed I was trying to skip it due to ulterior motives, I would have just told her to start over again <br>

## EEG 
(it was like an hr, a month after a major but brief paralysis attack). Nothing remarkable

## Cranial MRI with+w/o contrast  
only white matter hyperintensities apparently not a cause of concern and etiology still a medical debate 


<details>
Indication:SYNCOPE AND COLLAPSE 

Technique: Sagittal T1, axial T1, axial T2, axial FLAIR, coronal FLAIR, axial and coronal T1 postcontrast, diffusion and ADC map were obtained. The examination was performed before and after injection of 5.5 mL of Gadavist. 

Findings: 
Few tiny foci of T2 hyperintensity in bilateral frontal deep white matter represent nonspecific gliosis and of doubtful clinical significance. Dilated perivascular space in the right lentiform nucleus is a normal variant. No intracranial space-occupying lesions or abnormal enhancement. The craniocervical junction is unremarkable. No intracranial hemorrhage. No hydrocephalus. No midline shift. No evidence of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarction. The visualized intracranial flow-voids appear grossly unremarkable. Minimal mucosal thickening is seen in the anterior ethmoid air cells, the remaining visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells bilaterally are essentially well-aerated. 

Impression: 
Essentially unremarkable brain MRI without and with contrast.

## Loop recorder
didn't catch anything. I'd get a bill for every manual record I pressed so it was difficult to capture these as I would second guess myself and it would be too late if I finally fainted. But I did faint a few times and nothing got automatically triggered. Very confused about this 
They also told me there's no way it's dead already as they would have been notified first and I had to go there and they confirmed it was dead.   I can't afford to remove it...

## Various Blood tests
Several blood tests over the years and the only odd thing has been isolated b6 deficiency (meaning other b vitamins were normal) which is rare. Could be due to malabsorption of some sort?   
Also I tried quite a few times to get hormonal panels done with the gyn and was denied so I gave up. It costed money and pto just to ask.

## Cartoid Ultrasound
<details><summary>Unremarkable</summary>

IMPRESSION: <br>
1. Left carotid system: There was no stenosis or plaque noticed in the left ICA. The left ICA, CCA and ECA were within normal limits for the patient's stated age.   <br>
2. Right carotid system: There was no plaque noticed in the ICA, CCA, Or ECA. The right carotid system was within normal limits for the patient's stated age-   <br>
3. Bilaterally cervical vertebral antegrade flow.   
<Br><br>
CLINICAL HISTORY: The patient is a 30-year-old female with dizziness, syncope, and near syncope episode.  The blood pressure on the right side is 96/64 and on the left side is 80/60.   <br><br>
  
PROTOCOL: Extracranial carotid and vertebral arteries were interrogated using grayscale imaging, spectral waveform analysis, color flow imaging, and Color power Angio imaging.   
  <br><br>
FINDINGS:   
l. Left carotid duplex: There was no plaque noticed in the ICA, CCA, Or ECA. The peak ICA systolic velocity was 96 crn/s with end- diastolic velocity of 24 cm/s. The ICA/CCA systolic ratio was 0.8 and diastolic ratio was 1.1. <br>
2. Right carotid duplex: There was no plaque noticed in the ICA, CCA,0r ECA. The peak ICA systolic velocity was 103 cm/s with   
end-diastolic velocity of36 cru's. The ICA/CCA systolic ratio was 1.0 and diastolic ratio was 1.3   <br>
3. Bilaterally cervical vertebral antegrade flow.

## CT Maxillofacial W/O Contrast

<details><summary>Results</summary>
Impression
Tiny mucus retention cyst lateral right frontal paranasal sinus.

Remaining paranasal sinuses, ethmoid air cells and mastoid air cells
appear clear.

No osseous expansion, sclerosis or destruction.

Both ostiomeatal units are widely patent.

No nasal cavity mass or polypoid changes.



DATE OF EXAMINATION: 10/8/2021 2:30 PM

EXAMINATION: CT MAXILLOFACIAL WO CONTRAST

INDICATION(S): nasal congestion, evaluate migraines

NOTES AS REPORTED BY TECHNOLOGIST: Nasal congestion, migraines,
vertigo x 6 years, no priors, no surgeries, no history of cancer,
smoker

COMPARISON EXAM: None

FINDINGS:
There is a tiny globular focus of soft tissue density involving the
lateral right frontal paranasal sinus. Remaining paranasal sinuses,
ethmoid air cells and mastoid air cells appear clear.

No osseous expansion, sclerosis or destruction.

Both ostiomeatal units are widely patent.

There is mild leftward deviation the bony nasal septum with an apical
spur. However, no compromise of the left middle meatus.

No nasal cavity mass or polypoid change.

No acute osseous abnormality.

## Home monitoring devices
-**Glucose** has been caught multiple times in hypoglycemia levels (with symptoms) hours after carbs. Conclusive of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2645126/"> reactive hypoglycemia. </a> <br>
-**Blood pressure** has been taken moments before loss of consciousness showing remarkably low. <br> 
-**Heart rate** rises then plummets sharply vice versa  
-**o2** has been consistently well even during times of shortness of breath.  
-**Temp** appears challenging to accurately capture. Under the tongue and against temple is almost always 96 but that seems too low. Clinically I run around 98.   
-**6L ECG** rarely shows anything outside of benign pvcs

## Tests to be done:

### VEMP 
There's another place in town that does VEMP but I'm still upset about my experience with vestibular therapists. 

### Colonoscopy

### CT specifically for SCDS 
(this may be impossible to get in my city and I can't drive)
