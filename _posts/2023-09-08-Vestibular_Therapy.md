## Initial testing
 In 2018, I had originally had my first vestibular tests and VRT recommendations. At the time I had put this off due to financial issues. I realized I could just do these at home so what sense would it make to pay thousands of dollars when I could use that money for a second opinion or further investigation? 

## Vestibular Therapy
Many years went by and I had some extra health surprises along the way that postponed this including the pandemic, but I eventually returned to them in 2021 when my vestibular system got worse again after the covid vaccine. It was early release so I was not under any regulatory pressure to have taken it, and didn't assume it would do more than put me out for a few days. Unfortunately it threw me into a flare so intense that I was considering a wheelchair or rollator.  

There was a lot of controversy surrounding this at the time so I remained quiet and just told healthcare workers it must have been from covid because I was so weak and sick that I didn't have the strength for others to make this a political issue.  

Despite this, the first thing the vestibular therapist asked me was if I recentlly had the vaccine and I admitted I had. She did mention that this seemed to be a common theme with them. https://vestibular.org/forum/dizziness/covid-19-vaccine-side-effects/ 

Regardless, we dropped the subject and continued with treatment. 

I was scheduled to be there 2 days a week. I was unable to drive the distance to this area. It was in an adjoined city. So taking an uber/lyft would get me there but I'd have no way of getting home because the starting destination had no drivers. And perhaps I'm just not understanding things socially but I didn't have anyone available to be there for me 2x a week and assumed this was a normal problem for others but the workers seemed to be frustrated with me on this topic. 
Nonetheless I discovered that I could use paratransit if my PT cooperated with the paperwork which she did. Why didn't she suggest this in the first place? Again... maybe I truly am so isolated that I saw the prospect of having someone there for me at all times as incredulous. 

The exercises always temporarily corrected my balance disorder but the next large vertigo attack would set me back. As I've always known this to be an issue and explained it to them. They had to see it for themselves and also came to the conclusion in the end that until my vertigo attacks stop, the balance correction will always be set back. 

My insurance barely covered this so I ended up paying quite a bit for the sessions in the end. Theoretically I did this because I knew I had to prove that I tried it should I ever need less commonly covered treatments in the future such as botox or CGRPs, etc..

VNG (video nystagmography) performed as diagnostic test of inner ear function. This procedure is medically necessary to determine inner ear function and establish an appropriate plan of care/referral.
VNG shows abnormalities with positional testing which are not consistent with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Patient had a non fatiguing nystagmus which is a central sign. Patient opted to not have caloric testing performed due to anxiety about the test.
