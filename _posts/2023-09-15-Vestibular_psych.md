1. Introduction   
The vestibular system has traditionally been thought of as a balance apparatus that is related to brain disorders only when co-morbid symptoms include balance compromise, such as in Meniere′s disease and Parkinson′s disease. However, accumulating research suggests an association between vestibular function and psychiatric disorders, even when balance is apparently unaffected. Recent research has described the vestibular system as a potential window for exploring brain function beyond that of maintenance of balance, and into areas of perception, cognition, and consciousness (Lopez and Blanke, 2011). Existing research describes clear links between symptoms of anxiety and depression and the vestibular apparatus, and there is some preliminary evidence suggesting a link between the vestibular system and symptoms of psychosis and mania. Aspects of cognition, particularly spatial memory and spatial perception, have also been linked to vestibular function. The two key anatomical regions that provide links between the vestibular system and neural networks involved in cognitive and emotional processing are the parabrachial nucleus and the hippocampus (Balaban and Thayer, 2001, Balaban et al., 2002, Balaban, 2004a); however, many of the neuroanatomical regions that are linked to the vestibular system are also implicated in several psychiatric illnesses. The past decade has seen an increased interest in the relationship between the vestibular system and mood, cognition and psychiatric symptoms with studies demonstrating vestibular stimulation can produce changes in mood, cognition and psychiatric symptoms (Dodson, 2004, Levine et al., 2012, Winter et al., 2012). Hence, the time is now ripe to review the literature in an attempt to draw some overall conclusions. This review will firstly provide an overview of vestibular related brain structures that overlap with psychiatric disorders and then present a summary of how these regions of interest are implicated in prominent psychiatric disorder. The second section of the review will explore the cognitive and psychiatric symptoms that have been associated with vestibular (dys)function. Finally, we will bring these foci together to produce an overall summation of our current state of understanding of the relationship between vestibular function, psychiatric disorders, and cognition.
   
2. The vestibular system as a “Window to the Brain” for psychiatric symptoms
The vestibular system is vestigial and therefore intimately integrated into our central nervous system. Compromising a complex network of diverse pathways, there are vestibular origins within subcortical structures that traverse through the midbrain and then into the inner ear. With such diffuse connectivity, it is likely that vestibular function will be impacted upon at various stages of its pathways. Furthermore, it is comprised of both white matter and nerves, particularly the 8th cranial nerve (vestibulo-cochlear, which is a composite sensory nerve) hence vulnerable to different types of insults and/or compromised cell signalling. As illustrated in Fig. 1, neuroanatomical models of the vestibular system established through a variety of techniques including conventional and advanced structural MRI (e.g. T1-weighted and DTI), functional imaging (e.g. fMRI, magnetoencephalography (MEG)) and brain stimulation studies (e.g. galvanic or caloric vestibular stimulation; (Balaban and Jacob, 2001, Balaban et al., 2011, Bottini et al., 1994, Bottini et al., 1995, Bottini et al., 2001, Dieterich and Brandt, 2008, Emri et al., 2003, JA., 2004, Jones et al., 2009, Kisely et al., 2000, Kisely et al., 2002, Rochefort et al., 2013, Tuohimaa et al., 1983, Vitte et al., 1996, Wenzel et al., 1996) indicate that vestibular signals travel from the vestibular nuclei to brain stem nuclei, then project to subcortical structures, and regions well-known to be related to balance and muscle-coordination, such as the cerebellum, and those central to vision (specifically the occipital lobe) as well as direct and indirect projections to several cortical regions.

    


Whilst there is no direct evidence to suggest direct pathology of the vestibular apparatus in psychiatric disorders, there are many well identified links between the vestibular system and brain regions implicated in cognitive and emotion processing, which provide a potential neurological basis for the coexistence of vestibular and psychiatric symptoms (Balaban and Jacob, 2001, Yardley et al., 1999).
    
### Brainstem links to the vestibular system  
In terms of brainstem regions, the raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus are both implicated in several psychiatric conditions as well as having reciprocal connections with the vestibular nuclei. The raphe nuclei receives projections from the vestibular nuclei (Cuccurazzu and Halberstadt, 2008) and sends serotonergic and nonserotonergic projections to the vestibular nuclei (Halberstadt and Balaban, 2006, Kalen et al., 1985) as well as sending axon collaterals to the central amygdaloid nucleus, suggesting co-modulation of vestibular pathways with regions involved in affective control (Halberstadt and Balaban, 2006). The raphe-vestibular projections are organised into anatomically distinct fields which is thought to selectively modulate processing in regions of the vestibular nuclear complex that receive input from specific cerebellar zones, representing a potential mechanism whereby motor activity and behavioural arousal could influence the activity of cerebellovestibular circuits (Halberstadt and Balaban, 2003). The locus coeruleus provides noradrenergic innervation to the vestibular nuclei (Schuerger and Balaban, 1999), as well as collateral projections to regions including the cerebellum, neocortex and hypothalamus, which have been hypothesised to mediate effects of arousal on vestibular reflex performance. The locus coeruleus also responds to vestibular stimulation (Manzoni et al., 1989) via direct projections from the vestibular nuclei (Balaban, 1996) and input from vestibular related sources (Luppi et al., 1995).
  
### Limbic regions, parabrachial nucleus and the vestibular system
The limbic system is central to both vestibular function and emotional processing. The parabrachial nucleus (PBN) network provides a direct link between the vestibular system and neural networks involved in emotional processing. The PBN has reciprocal connections with the vestibular nuclei (Balaban and Thayer, 2001, Balaban, 2002, Balaban, 2004b), as well as reciprocal connections with the amygdala, hypothalamus, locus coeruleus, and prefrontal cortex (Balaban and Thayer, 2001, Gorman et al., 2000, Schuerger and Balaban, 1999). The amygdala, hypothalamus, locus coeruleus and prefrontal cortex are all areas of the brain that are commonly linked with mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression (e.g. Bennett, 2011; Brown et al., 2011). The hippocampus is consistently implicated in cognition and models of psychiatric disorders and there is a large body of evidence supporting vestibular–hippocampal interactions (e.g. Besnard et al., 2012, Brandt et al., 2005, Hufner et al., 2007, Sharp et al., 1995, Smith et al., 2005a).
  
### Cortical connections to the vestibular system  
The exact locations and functions of cortical regions that process vestibular information remains unclear (zu Eulenburg et al., 2012). The anterior cingulate cortex has been considered part of the human vestibular cortex (Bottini et al., 1995, Bottini et al., 2001, Lopez and Blanke, 2011, Lopez et al., 2012), hence it has been conceptualised that the anterior cingulate cortex may provide a bridge between the vestibular sensorimotor areas and the affect divisions of the prefrontal regions that entail motivational states (Bush et al., 2000). The insular cortex is one of the main cortical regions that receives information from the vestibular nuclei in the brain stem (Akbarian et al., 1994). The prefrontal cortex regions indirectly, by way of motor association cortices and anterior cingulate cortex, exert regulatory influence over the vestibular sensory areas for attenuation of sensory stimulation (Carmona et al., 2009). The parietal cortex, particular the parietal opercular area has been implicated as a core cortical region for vestibular processing (zu Eulenburg et al., 2012).  
  
### Neurochemical influences on the vestibular systems  
In addition to the neuroanatomical links, the vestibular system is implicated in both the serotonergic and dopaminergic systems, which are key neurotransmitter pathways involved in psychiatric disorders. Vestibular nucleus neurons respond to stimulation of the dorsal raphe nucleus (a key source of serotonergic input), as well as exogenous serotonin (Licata et al., 1995) and a rise in serotonin levels is observed in the medial vestibular nuclei following vestibular stimulation (i.e. caloric stimulation) (Halberstadt and Balaban, 2006). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are efficacious in the treatment of vertigo (Johnson, 1998) and SSRI withdrawal is associated with vestibular manifestations (i.e. dizziness) (Coupland et al., 1996). In relation to dopamine, dopamine (D2) receptors have been identified in neurons of the medial vestibular nucleus and the lateral vestibular nuclei (Smith, 2012, Smith and Darlington, 1994) and meaningful levels of dopamine have been detected in a region of the vestibular nuclei (Cransac et al., 1996). There is also evidence to suggest that dopamine might exert a modulatory action on the vestibular system, either by a direct action on the vestibular neurons or by modulation of GABAergic transmission (Vibert et al., 1995). In vestibular-compromised rats (following hemi-labyrinthectomy), treatment with a D2 agonist (bromocriptine) accelerates compensation of postural and ocular symptoms, whereas treatment with a D2 antagonist (sulpiride) slows down recovery, suggesting dopamine plays a role in the recovery from vestibular asymmetries (Petrosini and Dell′Anna, 1993).
  
### Vestibular related brain regions and psychiatric conditions  
On the basis of the mini-review above, 12 vestibular related brain regions (region of interest; ROI) known to be related to psychiatric conditions were selected: raphe nuclei, locus coreuleus, hippocampus, amygdala, insular cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, putamen, prefrontal cortex, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, and cerebellum. These ROIs were based upon a model of pathways involved in psychiatric and vestibular symptoms reviewed above. A MedLine search was conducted whereby imaging and electrophysiological peer-reviewed publications supporting the association of each ROI to a psychiatric condition were included. The psychiatric conditions included: Parkinson′s disease (PD), major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BPD), schizophrenia (SCZ), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) or obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It was not our intention to find every publication that matched our criteria, but rather, to reference a small collection of studies, meta-analyses or review papers (if available), to demonstrate that the relationship has been supported (Table 1).
