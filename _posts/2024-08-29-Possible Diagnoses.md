I'd like to rule out the following but have a feeling it is nearly impossible due to:   
    
1. <details><summary>Human error.</summary> Many of these tests are sensitive, meaning there's a higher likelihood of data mistenterpretation/human error than there is of an actual correct workflow of actions from person a through z.  </details>

2. <details><summary>Cost + transportation + time off work.</summary>It would take multiple visits (even multiple visits in the city with the actual equipment) to even convince them to allow me to test, and the machines are not in this city. The cost for all of this once said and done would be steep for a maybe.</details>       

3. <details><summary> Stigma</summary> I have also heard from medical workers that medical resources are finite and they don't think most patients are special enough to need these but they eventually cave in if the patient really keeps whining. This is not a method I feel comfortable with, as I don't have it in me to annoy someone for survival, especially if I'm not 100% certain the findings will show abnormalities.

<h3>SCDS</h3>  
  <br>
<details><summary>Superior Canal Dehiscence Syndrome (SCDS)is a rare condition where there is an opening in the bone covering the superior semicircular canal of the inner ear. This can lead to balance and hearing issues, such as vertigo, oscillopsia (visual disturbances), and hearing loss. I have transient but not permanent hearing loss so unsure of this </summary>

 Diagnostic Tools <br>  
 
 **CT Scans**:  Standard CT scans typically have thicker slices and may not capture the fine details required. 
For SCDS, a high-resolution CT scan of the temporal bone with very thin slices (0.6 mm or less) is essential.  These CT scanners are not near me and I'd have to travel. Cost around $2k just for the scan itself.    
<br>
 **VEMP Testing**: Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potentials (VEMP) tests assess the function of the inner ear and its response to sound. <br>   
 **Audiometry**: Hearing tests to evaluate the extent of hearing loss.      
<br><br>
 Specialists Involved:  <br>  
  **Neurotologists**: These are ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialists with additional training in neurological aspects of ear disorders. <br>   
  **ENT Specialists**: General ENT doctors can also be involved, especially those with a focus on vestibular disorders.    
<br><br>
  Treatment Options   <br> 
   **Conservative Management**: For mild symptoms, avoiding triggers and using vestibular physical therapy can help manage the condition.<br>
   **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to plug the dehiscence. This involves making a small hole in the skull to access and repair the inner ear.    <br>

<h3>Eagle syndrome </h3>
<details><summary>
Eagle syndrome is a rare condition characterized by an elongated styloid process (a small bone below the ear) or a calcified stylohyoid ligament. This can cause a variety of symptoms, including:

- Pain in the throat, face, or neck
- Difficulty swallowing
- Feeling of something stuck in the throat
- Tinnitus (ringing in the ears)
- Dizziness
- Headaches
</summary>
### Diagnostic Tests
To diagnose Eagle syndrome, doctors typically use:
- **Physical Examination**: Palpation of the tonsillar area to check for tenderness⁸.
- **Imaging Tests**: CT scans or X-rays to visualize the elongated styloid process or calcified ligament⁶⁷.

### Specialists Involved
- **Otolaryngologists (ENT Specialists)**: These doctors specialize in ear, nose, and throat conditions and are often the primary specialists involved in diagnosing and treating Eagle syndrome⁸.
- **Dentists and Oral Surgeons**: Sometimes involved if the symptoms are related to dental issues⁹.
- **Neurologists**: May be consulted if there are nerve-related symptoms⁹.

### Treatment Options
- **Medications**: Pain relievers, anti-inflammatory drugs, and corticosteroid injections can help manage symptoms²³.
- **Surgery**: The most definitive treatment involves shortening the styloid process through a procedure called styloidectomy. This can be done through the mouth or an external incision

<h3>Adrenal Insufficiency</h3>
<details><summary>Adrenal insufficiency is a condition where the adrenal glands do not produce enough of certain hormones, primarily cortisol and sometimes aldosterone. This can lead to symptoms such as chronic fatigue, muscle weakness, abdominal pain, low blood pressure, hypoglycemia, and weight loss </summary>

### Diagnostic Tests
To diagnose adrenal insufficiency, doctors typically use:
- **Blood Tests**: These measure levels of cortisol, sodium, potassium, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).
- **ACTH Stimulation Test**: This involves injecting synthetic ACTH and measuring cortisol levels before and after the injection to see how the adrenal glands respond.
- **Insulin Tolerance Test (ITT)**: Used to assess the pituitary gland's function by inducing hypoglycemia and measuring cortisol response¹⁴.
- **CRH Stimulation Test**: Helps identify secondary adrenal insufficiency by measuring the response to corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH).
- **Imaging Tests**: MRI or CT scans may be used to identify any structural abnormalities in the adrenal or pituitary glands¹⁵.

### Specialists Involved
- **Endocrinologists**: Specialists in hormone-related conditions who can diagnose and manage adrenal insufficiency⁵.
- **Primary Care Physicians**: Often the first to suspect and refer patients to endocrinologists for further evaluation⁵.

### Treatment Options
- **Hormone Replacement Therapy**: The main treatment involves replacing the deficient hormones with medications such as hydrocortisone, prednisone, or dexamethasone for cortisol, and fludrocortisone for aldosterone.
- **Adjustments for Stress**: Dosages may need to be adjusted during periods of stress, illness, or surgery to mimic the body's natural response¹².
- **Emergency Treatment**: In cases of adrenal crisis, immediate treatment with intravenous hydrocortisone, saline, and dextrose is necessary
