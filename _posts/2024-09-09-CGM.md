Acquired a CGM - Stelo

<br>
They seemed to have designed this to not alert for hypoglycemia or show levels below 70. I had to obtain a secondary app called Dexcom Clarity so I could see the raw data which doesn't appear immediately.  
Apparently it's considered a medical event that is to be handled by a dr if it falls below 70 so they can't show/alert. 

I'd like to get one that alerts hypoglycemia but I need a medical based CGM. Medical based CGMs are difficult to get approved by insurance. Pretty much impossible without diabetes + insulin.  

So this is my workaround in the meantime.  

Hoping for an app that will bypass this soon as the other CGMs have a few 3rd party apps.

I don't have ios but apparently there's also an app called Shugah for iphone users. 



The first night I wore this, it indicated severe hypoglycemia for extended periods while I slept. I'm not sure if the device was still in some warm up phase. But then it continued. Some nights I'd be ok and others I'd continue to dip way too low.

I also seem to be dipping low during exercise.  
 One notable instance on 9-9, it had peaked to 180 from carbs and wasn't coming down so I decided to jog and nearly blacked out after 1.5mi. After I was able to review the data it showed I was in the low 50s.

Conclusively, whereas I assumed reactive hypoglycemia was my only problem.. it seems something is faulty in general with my insulin production. Unless this is normal for most non diabetic individuals and I'm just being dramatic because I can see the data that most people are not paying attention to?   

The CGM also provided GMI which is apparently closely equivalent to a1c in value. I seem to be on the edge of prediabetes I'm assuming due to my own negligence in diet. So perhaps I am somewhat diabetic, unsure if this would be the cause of so many hypoglycemic events however?

Noticed xdrip has support for stelo and attempted this on 1/17
https://navid200.github.io/xDrip/docs/Dexcom/G7.html


Primary phone: galaxy s21 5g android 13 one ui version 5.0; 
spare phone no sim: samsung s10e android 12 one ui 4.1;


It appears to have issues on my primary device, s21. It connects but once it loses a connection and indicates 'sensor error', it's unable to ever recover itself.  
I've attempted to remove and re-pair the bluetooth device , modify various settings, restart collector, use different app builds, etc and the issue continues. I've also followed instructions here https://navid200.github.io/xDrip/docs/Intermittent.html
The sensor itself has no issues with the original stelo app on my s21 also.  

 I have to completely restore the app to factory defaults before it will work again which is not useable and I do not have the time to work on this as it must be resolved before the battery life of a few weeks.   
  
I was able to get this functional on a spare s10e without issue however which identifies the issue is not with the sensor or how I followed instructions. When the s10e loses the signal momentarily it will simply re-establish itself automatically.  I'm using it as a host and my primary as follower as a workaround 

However on my second sensor, it had no problem with xdrip which then also allowed me to obtain the nightscout watchface on my Garmin Venu 2 plus. I could not only see my glucose at all times on my watch but could 

I was finally able to also set an alarm for hypoglycemia. 
Unfortunately I dip so much at night I had to disable this at night. 

Is this actually hypo or sensory compression? I am assuming legit hypo many times since it follows the pattern of hormonal issues where I'll go a week or two with this issue and a week or two without. I also am using contour meter to calibrate readings occasionally also via BT and so far the values have been very close
