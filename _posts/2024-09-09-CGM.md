Acquired a CGM - Stelo

<br>
They seemed to have designed this to not alert for hypoglycemia or show levels below 70. I had to obtain a secondary app called Dexcom Clarity so I could see the raw data which doesn't appear immediately.  
Apparently it's considered a medical event that is to be handled by a dr if it falls below 70 so they can't show/alert. 

I'd like to get one that alerts hypoglycemia but I need a medical based CGM. Medical based CGMs are difficult to get approved by insurance. Pretty much impossible without diabetes + insulin.  

So this is my workaround in the meantime.  

Hoping for an app that will bypass this soon as the other CGMs have a few 3rd party apps.

I don't have ios but apparently there's also an app called Shugah for iphone users. 



The first night I wore this, it indicated severe hypoglycemia for extended periods while I slept. I'm not sure if the device was still in some warm up phase. But then it continued. Some nights I'd be ok and others I'd continue to dip way too low.

I also seem to be dipping low during exercise.  
 One notable instance on 9-9, it had peaked to 180 from carbs and wasn't coming down so I decided to jog and nearly blacked out after 1.5mi. After I was able to review the data it showed I was in the low 50s.

Conclusively, whereas I assumed reactive hypoglycemia was my only problem.. it seems something is faulty in general with my insulin production. Unless this is normal for most non diabetic individuals and I'm just being dramatic because I can see the data that most people are not paying attention to?   

The CGM also provided GMI which is apparently closely equivalent to a1c in value. I seem to be on the edge of prediabetes I'm assuming due to my own negligence in diet. So perhaps I am somewhat diabetic, unsure if this would be the cause of so many hypoglycemic events however?
