##  Dysbiosis May Be the Root Cause

### Initial Onset
- My health issues began after a severe flu, leading to chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS).
- Viruses are known to disrupt gut bacteria, and I suspected my microbiome might play a role in my symptoms.

### Azithromycin Experiment
- The first time I took azithromycin, I experienced:
  - Severe stomach pain initially.
  - A sudden, complete resolution of all symptoms for half a week.
- Subsequent doses of azithromycin had much weaker effects, suggesting it disrupted harmful bacteria but couldn't restore long-term balance.

### Attempts to Restore Balance
- I tried prebiotics and probiotic-rich foods, but my baseline symptoms gradually returned.
- The challenge seemed to be finding the right balance in my microbiome.

### The Turning Point
- A few years later, after becoming ill again, I experienced:
  - A month of fecal incontinence where food passed right through me.
  - Complete "emptiness" in my gut.
- I introduced a medical-grade probiotic (Visbiome), which:
  - Resolved the incontinence.
  - Improved my IBS, CFS, and POTS better than before I got sick.

### Key Insights
- Temporary improvements with azithromycin suggest harmful bacteria played a role.
- The dramatic improvement with the medical-grade probiotic implies dysbiosis was central to my symptoms.
- Gut "resetting" after illness may have allowed probiotics to take effect, highlighting the complex relationship between gut health and systemic conditions.

### The GI Tract, Gravity Management, and Vestibular Symptoms

This passage explores how the gastrointestinal (GI) tract interacts with gravity-related challenges, the brain, and vestibular symptoms, contributing to conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS):

#### Gravity's Impact on the Gut
1. Gravity can strain the intestines in susceptible individuals, causing compression, kinking, or pressurization.

#### Chain Reaction in the Gut
1. Intestinal movement slows down (**dysmotility**) and contents stagnate (**stasis**).
2. Changes in the gut microbiome (**dysbiosis**) lead to:
   - Excess serotonin and other chemicals.
   - Disruption of the gut lining, immune issues, and increased nerve sensitivity.
3. Sensitized nerves send stronger pain signals to the brain.

#### Vestibular Symptoms and Brain Response
1. Vestibular symptoms (e.g., dizziness or imbalance) arise as part of the brain's detection of gravitational misalignment.
2. The brain attempts to compensate by adjusting:
   - Physiological, psychological, and behavioral states to reduce strain.
3. Stress and sleep disturbances further disrupt:
   - **Gut function** via hormonal (HPA axis) and nervous system (ANS) dysregulation.
   - Vestibular function, creating a feedback loop between the brain, vestibular system, and GI tract.

#### Vicious Cycle
1. Disrupted vestibular input worsens brain compensation mechanisms.
2. Combined with GI dysfunction, this amplifies symptoms such as:
   - Chronic dizziness and imbalance.
   - Pain and discomfort in the gut.
3. This cycle perpetuates dysfunction across the brain-gut-vestibular axis.

#### Alternative Hypothesis
- The process might begin in the brain or vestibular system:
  1. Brain or vestibular abnormalities (e.g., poor gravity support, disrupted sleep, stress) affect the gut.
  2. This results in IBS symptoms like visceral sensitization, altered GI physiology, and worsening vestibular symptoms.

### Key Terms
- **ANS**: Autonomic nervous system.
- **HPA**: Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.
- **IBS**: Irritable bowel syndrome.
- **GI**: Gastrointestinal tract.
- **Vestibular symptoms**: Dizziness, vertigo, or imbalance.
