    "content": "Dysbiosis May Be the Root CauseInitial Onset  My health issues began after a severe flu, leading to chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS).  Viruses are known to disrupt gut bacteria, and I suspected my microbiome might play a role in my symptoms.Azithromycin Experiment  The first time I took azithromycin, I experienced:          Severe stomach pain initially.      A sudden, complete resolution of all symptoms for half a week.        Subsequent doses of azithromycin had much weaker effects, suggesting it disrupted harmful bacteria but couldn’t restore long-term balance.Attempts to Restore Balance  I tried prebiotics and probiotic-rich foods, but my baseline symptoms gradually returned.  The challenge seemed to be finding the right balance in my microbiome.The Turning Point  A few years later, after becoming ill again, I experienced:          A month of fecal incontinence where food passed right through me.      Complete “emptiness” in my gut.        I introduced a medical-grade probiotic (Visbiome), which:          Resolved the incontinence.      Improved my IBS, CFS, and POTS better than before I got sick.      Key Insights  Temporary improvements with azithromycin suggest harmful bacteria played a role.  The dramatic improvement with the medical-grade probiotic implies dysbiosis was central to my symptoms.  Gut “resetting” after illness may have allowed probiotics to take effect, highlighting the complex relationship between gut health and systemic conditions.Studies hypothesizing vestibular symptoms from dysbiosisThe GI Tract, Gravity Management, and Vestibular SymptomsThis passage explores how the gastrointestinal (GI) tract interacts with gravity-related challenges, the brain, and vestibular symptoms, contributing to conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS):Gravity’s Impact on the Gut  Gravity can strain the intestines in susceptible individuals, causing compression, kinking, or pressurization.Chain Reaction in the Gut  Intestinal movement slows down (dysmotility) and contents stagnate (stasis).  Changes in the gut microbiome (dysbiosis) lead to:          Excess serotonin and other chemicals.      Disruption of the gut lining, immune issues, and increased nerve sensitivity.        Sensitized nerves send stronger pain signals to the brain.Vestibular Symptoms and Brain Response  Vestibular symptoms (e.g., dizziness or imbalance) arise as part of the brain’s detection of gravitational misalignment.  The brain attempts to compensate by adjusting:          Physiological, psychological, and behavioral states to reduce strain.        Stress and sleep disturbances further disrupt:          Gut function via hormonal (HPA axis) and nervous system (ANS) dysregulation.      Vestibular function, creating a feedback loop between the brain, vestibular system, and GI tract.      Vicious Cycle  Disrupted vestibular input worsens brain compensation mechanisms.  Combined with GI dysfunction, this amplifies symptoms such as:          Chronic dizziness and imbalance.      Pain and discomfort in the gut.        This cycle perpetuates dysfunction across the brain-gut-vestibular axis.Alternative Hypothesis  The process might begin in the brain or vestibular system:          Brain or vestibular abnormalities (e.g., poor gravity support, disrupted sleep, stress) affect the gut.      This results in IBS symptoms like visceral sensitization, altered GI physiology, and worsening vestibular symptoms.      Key Terms  ANS: Autonomic nervous system.  HPA: Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.  IBS: Irritable bowel syndrome.  GI: Gastrointestinal tract.  Vestibular symptoms: Dizziness, vertigo, or imbalance."

    "content": "Acquired a CGM - SteloThey seemed to have designed this to not alert for hypoglycemia or show levels below 70. I had to obtain a secondary app called Dexcom Clarity so I could see the raw data which doesn’t appear immediately.Apparently it’s considered a medical event that is to be handled by a dr if it falls below 70 so they can’t show/alert.I’d like to get one that alerts hypoglycemia but I need a medical based CGM. Medical based CGMs are difficult to get approved by insurance. Pretty much impossible without diabetes + insulin.So this is my workaround in the meantime.Hoping for an app that will bypass this soon as the other CGMs have a few 3rd party apps. BYOD and XdripI don’t have ios but apparently there’s also an app called Shugah for iphone users.The first night I wore this, it indicated severe hypoglycemia for extended periods while I slept. I’m not sure if the device was still in some warm up phase. But then it continued. Some nights I’d be ok and others I’d continue to dip way too low.I also seem to be dipping low during exercise. One notable instance on 9-9, it had peaked to 180 from carbs and wasn’t coming down so I decided to jog and nearly blacked out after 1.5mi. After I was able to review the data it showed I was in the low 50s.Conclusively, whereas I assumed reactive hypoglycemia was my only problem.. it seems something is faulty in general with my insulin production. Unless this is normal for most non diabetic individuals and I’m just being dramatic because I can see the data that most people are not paying attention to?The CGM also provided GMI which is apparently closely equivalent to a1c in value. I seem to be on the edge of prediabetes I’m assuming due to my own negligence in diet. So perhaps I am somewhat diabetic, unsure if this would be the cause of so many hypoglycemic events however?  Hourly stats:1/20/2025Noticed xdrip has support for stelo and attempted this on 1/17https://navid200.github.io/xDrip/docs/Dexcom/G7.htmlPrimary phone: galaxy s21 5g android 13 one ui version 5.0; spare phone no sim: samsung s10e android 12 one ui 4.1;It appears to have issues on my primary device, s21. It connects but once it loses a connection and indicates ‘sensor error’, it’s unable to ever recover itself.I’ve attempted to remove and re-pair the bluetooth device , modify various settings, restart collector, use different app builds, etc and the issue continues. I’ve also followed instructions here https://navid200.github.io/xDrip/docs/Intermittent.htmlThe sensor itself has no issues with the original stelo app on my s21 also.I have to completely restore the app to factory defaults before it will work again which is not useable and I do not have the time to work on this as it must be resolved before the battery life of a few weeks.I was able to get this functional on a spare s10e without issue however which identifies the issue is not with the sensor or how I followed instructions. When the s10e loses the signal momentarily it will simply re-establish itself automatically.  I’m using it as a host and my primary as follower as a workaroundHowever on my second sensor, it had no problem with xdrip which then also allowed me to obtain the nightscout watchface on my Garmin Venu 2 plus. I could not only see my glucose at all times on my watch but couldI was finally able to also set an alarm for hypoglycemia. Unfortunately I dip so much at night I had to disable this at night.Is this actually hypo or sensory compression? I am assuming legit hypo many times since it follows the pattern of hormonal issues where I’ll go a week or two with this issue and a week or two without. I also am using contour meter to calibrate readings occasionally also via BT and so far the values have been very close&lt;img src=”/assets/img/stelo_watch_glucosemeter.png&gt;"

    "content": "I’d like to rule out the following but have a feeling it is nearly impossible due to:      Human error. Many of these tests are sensitive, meaning there's a higher likelihood of data mistenterpretation/human error than there is of an actual correct workflow of actions from person a through z.          Cost + transportation + time off work.It would take multiple visits (even multiple visits in the city with the actual equipment) to even convince them to allow me to test, and the machines are not in this city. The cost for all of this once said and done would be steep for a maybe.         Stigma I have also heard from medical workers that medical resources are finite and they don't think most patients are special enough to need these but they eventually cave in if the patient really keeps whining. This is not a method I feel comfortable with, as I don't have it in me to annoy someone for survival, especially if I'm not 100% certain the findings will show abnormalities.  SCDSSuperior Canal Dehiscence Syndrome (SCDS)is a rare condition where there is an opening in the bone covering the superior semicircular canal of the inner ear. This can lead to balance and hearing issues, such as vertigo, oscillopsia (visual disturbances), and hearing loss. I have transient but not permanent hearing loss so unsure of this  Diagnostic Tools     **CT Scans**:  Standard CT scans typically have thicker slices and may not capture the fine details required. For SCDS, a high-resolution CT scan of the temporal bone with very thin slices (0.6 mm or less) is essential.  These CT scanners are not near me and I'd have to travel. Cost around $2k just for the scan itself.     **VEMP Testing**: Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potentials (VEMP) tests assess the function of the inner ear and its response to sound.     **Audiometry**: Hearing tests to evaluate the extent of hearing loss.       Specialists Involved:      **Neurotologists**: These are ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialists with additional training in neurological aspects of ear disorders.      **ENT Specialists**: General ENT doctors can also be involved, especially those with a focus on vestibular disorders.      Treatment Options       **Conservative Management**: For mild symptoms, avoiding triggers and using vestibular physical therapy can help manage the condition.   **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to plug the dehiscence. This involves making a small hole in the skull to access and repair the inner ear.    Eagle Syndrome      Eagle syndrome is a rare condition characterized by an elongated styloid process (a small bone below the ear) or a calcified stylohyoid ligament. This can cause a variety of symptoms, including:     Pain in the throat, face, or neck  Difficulty swallowing  Feeling of something stuck in the throat  Tinnitus (ringing in the ears)  Dizziness  Headaches   Diagnostic Tests  To diagnose Eagle syndrome, doctors typically use:      Physical Examination: Palpation of the tonsillar area to check for tenderness.    Imaging Tests: CT scans or X-rays to visualize the elongated styloid process or calcified ligament.    Specialists Involved      Otolaryngologists (ENT Specialists): Specialize in ear, nose, and throat conditions.    Dentists and Oral Surgeons: Sometimes involved if symptoms relate to dental issues.    Neurologists: Consulted for nerve-related symptoms.    Treatment Options      Medications: Pain relievers, anti-inflammatory drugs, and corticosteroid injections to manage symptoms.    Surgery: The definitive treatment involves shortening the styloid process through a procedure called styloidectomy.  Adrenal InsufficiencyAdrenal insufficiency is a condition where the adrenal glands do not produce enough of certain hormones, primarily cortisol and sometimes aldosterone. This can lead to symptoms such as chronic fatigue, muscle weakness, abdominal pain, low blood pressure, hypoglycemia, and weight loss ### Diagnostic TestsTo diagnose adrenal insufficiency, doctors typically use:- **Blood Tests**: These measure levels of cortisol, sodium, potassium, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).- **ACTH Stimulation Test**: This involves injecting synthetic ACTH and measuring cortisol levels before and after the injection to see how the adrenal glands respond.- **Insulin Tolerance Test (ITT)**: Used to assess the pituitary gland's function by inducing hypoglycemia and measuring cortisol response.- **CRH Stimulation Test**: Helps identify secondary adrenal insufficiency by measuring the response to corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH).- **Imaging Tests**: MRI or CT scans may be used to identify any structural abnormalities in the adrenal or pituitary glands.### Specialists Involved- **Endocrinologists**: Specialists in hormone-related conditions who can diagnose and manage adrenal insufficiency.- **Primary Care Physicians**: Often the first to suspect and refer patients to endocrinologists for further evaluation.### Treatment Options- **Hormone Replacement Therapy**: The main treatment involves replacing the deficient hormones with medications such as hydrocortisone, prednisone, or dexamethasone for cortisol, and fludrocortisone for aldosterone.- **Adjustments for Stress**: Dosages may need to be adjusted during periods of stress, illness, or surgery to mimic the body's natural response.- **Emergency Treatment**: In cases of adrenal crisis, immediate treatment with intravenous hydrocortisone, saline, and dextrose is necessary"

    "content": "As of 5/2/24 I have reduced POTS, PPPD, and IBS. Vertigo attacks are still to date the most intense thing I think I will ever experience. Once I was able to quell severe attacks with ativan, I no longer feared them in the same way.I also got a head start on things as I had fallen ill with a gastrointestinal illness and I was having issues with it not being eradicated. I was basically barely eating and everything was leaving my system fast… so I loaded on medical grade probiotics. This not only fixed my issue but my IBS was gone. Where as I’ve tried probiotics in the past without this success. I think it had something to do with having such an empty gi tract as a base.I had pathetic attempts in the past of running daily. It would both cause severe stomach pain (to the point of fainting over and over on the floor all night) and increase my vertigo attacks. I no longer experience severe pain. And I can escape the panic that vertigo attacks present.I still have issues if I pushed myself too hard but I’ve made it to one mile a day after a year.The days I try 5k I must be so careful as I’ve made myself sick for weeks after. Malaise, anxiety, flu like symptoms, etc. I’ve also lost consciousness a few times which led to injuries.I never seem to improve my pace and it’s worse than a beginners level. It often will get worse for weeks then back to baseline. I try to keep myself in the orange zone for heart rate to avoid a crash and I notice myself never adapting to the higher speeds. I still break out in a significant sweat after half a mile.Also Ativan has an unfortunate side effect for me of causing panic/high anxiety the next day. To the point I am quite debilitated. I’m not sure why this happens on such a low dose .5 - 1mg when I rarely take it (once a month). But I have heard from one other person with the same vestibular condition that she experiences the same issue.As of right now I still deal with:vertigo attackspoisoned feeling, malaise?crampsodd neuro issues (assuming migraine aura)fatigueI still can't drive well if at all. Everytime I have to turn my head sharply, accelerate, sudden movements in an odd way... everything starts to spin which is likely to cause an accident in the middle of traffic. I don't really know how I will ever overcome that one. I try to keep my driving short, infrequent, and in the city.  I've been told by multiple HCWs I should be able to still drive. I looked it up and for this state in particular a doctor does not have to legally report you, so if I were to get into an accident with their recommendations that I continue to drive, the fault is still 100% my own and the HCW has absolutely no legal reprocussions. This leads me to believe they simply just tell most people to drive anyways as it is more work to tell a patient they may not be able to. While I appreciate the freedom, their ability to emphasize that I should still drive during an attack puts me in a situation where it looks like I'm just being stubborn and my symptoms aren't really that bad.

    "content": "      Introduction The vestibular system has traditionally been thought of as a balance apparatus that is related to brain disorders only when co-morbid symptoms include balance compromise, such as in Meniere′s disease and Parkinson′s disease. However, accumulating research suggests an association between vestibular function and psychiatric disorders, even when balance is apparently unaffected. Recent research has described the vestibular system as a potential window for exploring brain function beyond that of maintenance of balance, and into areas of perception, cognition, and consciousness (Lopez and Blanke, 2011). Existing research describes clear links between symptoms of anxiety and depression and the vestibular apparatus, and there is some preliminary evidence suggesting a link between the vestibular system and symptoms of psychosis and mania. Aspects of cognition, particularly spatial memory and spatial perception, have also been linked to vestibular function. The two key anatomical regions that provide links between the vestibular system and neural networks involved in cognitive and emotional processing are the parabrachial nucleus and the hippocampus (Balaban and Thayer, 2001, Balaban et al., 2002, Balaban, 2004a); however, many of the neuroanatomical regions that are linked to the vestibular system are also implicated in several psychiatric illnesses. The past decade has seen an increased interest in the relationship between the vestibular system and mood, cognition and psychiatric symptoms with studies demonstrating vestibular stimulation can produce changes in mood, cognition and psychiatric symptoms (Dodson, 2004, Levine et al., 2012, Winter et al., 2012). Hence, the time is now ripe to review the literature in an attempt to draw some overall conclusions. This review will firstly provide an overview of vestibular related brain structures that overlap with psychiatric disorders and then present a summary of how these regions of interest are implicated in prominent psychiatric disorder. The second section of the review will explore the cognitive and psychiatric symptoms that have been associated with vestibular (dys)function. Finally, we will bring these foci together to produce an overall summation of our current state of understanding of the relationship between vestibular function, psychiatric disorders, and cognition.        The vestibular system as a “Window to the Brain” for psychiatric symptomsThe vestibular system is vestigial and therefore intimately integrated into our central nervous system. Compromising a complex network of diverse pathways, there are vestibular origins within subcortical structures that traverse through the midbrain and then into the inner ear. With such diffuse connectivity, it is likely that vestibular function will be impacted upon at various stages of its pathways. Furthermore, it is comprised of both white matter and nerves, particularly the 8th cranial nerve (vestibulo-cochlear, which is a composite sensory nerve) hence vulnerable to different types of insults and/or compromised cell signalling. As illustrated in Fig. 1, neuroanatomical models of the vestibular system established through a variety of techniques including conventional and advanced structural MRI (e.g. T1-weighted and DTI), functional imaging (e.g. fMRI, magnetoencephalography (MEG)) and brain stimulation studies (e.g. galvanic or caloric vestibular stimulation; (Balaban and Jacob, 2001, Balaban et al., 2011, Bottini et al., 1994, Bottini et al., 1995, Bottini et al., 2001, Dieterich and Brandt, 2008, Emri et al., 2003, JA., 2004, Jones et al., 2009, Kisely et al., 2000, Kisely et al., 2002, Rochefort et al., 2013, Tuohimaa et al., 1983, Vitte et al., 1996, Wenzel et al., 1996) indicate that vestibular signals travel from the vestibular nuclei to brain stem nuclei, then project to subcortical structures, and regions well-known to be related to balance and muscle-coordination, such as the cerebellum, and those central to vision (specifically the occipital lobe) as well as direct and indirect projections to several cortical regions.  Whilst there is no direct evidence to suggest direct pathology of the vestibular apparatus in psychiatric disorders, there are many well identified links between the vestibular system and brain regions implicated in cognitive and emotion processing, which provide a potential neurological basis for the coexistence of vestibular and psychiatric symptoms (Balaban and Jacob, 2001, Yardley et al., 1999).Brainstem links to the vestibular systemIn terms of brainstem regions, the raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus are both implicated in several psychiatric conditions as well as having reciprocal connections with the vestibular nuclei. The raphe nuclei receives projections from the vestibular nuclei (Cuccurazzu and Halberstadt, 2008) and sends serotonergic and nonserotonergic projections to the vestibular nuclei (Halberstadt and Balaban, 2006, Kalen et al., 1985) as well as sending axon collaterals to the central amygdaloid nucleus, suggesting co-modulation of vestibular pathways with regions involved in affective control (Halberstadt and Balaban, 2006). The raphe-vestibular projections are organised into anatomically distinct fields which is thought to selectively modulate processing in regions of the vestibular nuclear complex that receive input from specific cerebellar zones, representing a potential mechanism whereby motor activity and behavioural arousal could influence the activity of cerebellovestibular circuits (Halberstadt and Balaban, 2003). The locus coeruleus provides noradrenergic innervation to the vestibular nuclei (Schuerger and Balaban, 1999), as well as collateral projections to regions including the cerebellum, neocortex and hypothalamus, which have been hypothesised to mediate effects of arousal on vestibular reflex performance. The locus coeruleus also responds to vestibular stimulation (Manzoni et al., 1989) via direct projections from the vestibular nuclei (Balaban, 1996) and input from vestibular related sources (Luppi et al., 1995).Limbic regions, parabrachial nucleus and the vestibular systemThe limbic system is central to both vestibular function and emotional processing. The parabrachial nucleus (PBN) network provides a direct link between the vestibular system and neural networks involved in emotional processing. The PBN has reciprocal connections with the vestibular nuclei (Balaban and Thayer, 2001, Balaban, 2002, Balaban, 2004b), as well as reciprocal connections with the amygdala, hypothalamus, locus coeruleus, and prefrontal cortex (Balaban and Thayer, 2001, Gorman et al., 2000, Schuerger and Balaban, 1999). The amygdala, hypothalamus, locus coeruleus and prefrontal cortex are all areas of the brain that are commonly linked with mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression (e.g. Bennett, 2011; Brown et al., 2011). The hippocampus is consistently implicated in cognition and models of psychiatric disorders and there is a large body of evidence supporting vestibular–hippocampal interactions (e.g. Besnard et al., 2012, Brandt et al., 2005, Hufner et al., 2007, Sharp et al., 1995, Smith et al., 2005a).Cortical connections to the vestibular systemThe exact locations and functions of cortical regions that process vestibular information remains unclear (zu Eulenburg et al., 2012). The anterior cingulate cortex has been considered part of the human vestibular cortex (Bottini et al., 1995, Bottini et al., 2001, Lopez and Blanke, 2011, Lopez et al., 2012), hence it has been conceptualised that the anterior cingulate cortex may provide a bridge between the vestibular sensorimotor areas and the affect divisions of the prefrontal regions that entail motivational states (Bush et al., 2000). The insular cortex is one of the main cortical regions that receives information from the vestibular nuclei in the brain stem (Akbarian et al., 1994). The prefrontal cortex regions indirectly, by way of motor association cortices and anterior cingulate cortex, exert regulatory influence over the vestibular sensory areas for attenuation of sensory stimulation (Carmona et al., 2009). The parietal cortex, particular the parietal opercular area has been implicated as a core cortical region for vestibular processing (zu Eulenburg et al., 2012).Neurochemical influences on the vestibular systemsIn addition to the neuroanatomical links, the vestibular system is implicated in both the serotonergic and dopaminergic systems, which are key neurotransmitter pathways involved in psychiatric disorders. Vestibular nucleus neurons respond to stimulation of the dorsal raphe nucleus (a key source of serotonergic input), as well as exogenous serotonin (Licata et al., 1995) and a rise in serotonin levels is observed in the medial vestibular nuclei following vestibular stimulation (i.e. caloric stimulation) (Halberstadt and Balaban, 2006). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are efficacious in the treatment of vertigo (Johnson, 1998) and SSRI withdrawal is associated with vestibular manifestations (i.e. dizziness) (Coupland et al., 1996). In relation to dopamine, dopamine (D2) receptors have been identified in neurons of the medial vestibular nucleus and the lateral vestibular nuclei (Smith, 2012, Smith and Darlington, 1994) and meaningful levels of dopamine have been detected in a region of the vestibular nuclei (Cransac et al., 1996). There is also evidence to suggest that dopamine might exert a modulatory action on the vestibular system, either by a direct action on the vestibular neurons or by modulation of GABAergic transmission (Vibert et al., 1995). In vestibular-compromised rats (following hemi-labyrinthectomy), treatment with a D2 agonist (bromocriptine) accelerates compensation of postural and ocular symptoms, whereas treatment with a D2 antagonist (sulpiride) slows down recovery, suggesting dopamine plays a role in the recovery from vestibular asymmetries (Petrosini and Dell′Anna, 1993).Vestibular related brain regions and psychiatric conditionsOn the basis of the mini-review above, 12 vestibular related brain regions (region of interest; ROI) known to be related to psychiatric conditions were selected: raphe nuclei, locus coreuleus, hippocampus, amygdala, insular cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, putamen, prefrontal cortex, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, and cerebellum. These ROIs were based upon a model of pathways involved in psychiatric and vestibular symptoms reviewed above. A MedLine search was conducted whereby imaging and electrophysiological peer-reviewed publications supporting the association of each ROI to a psychiatric condition were included. The psychiatric conditions included: Parkinson′s disease (PD), major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BPD), schizophrenia (SCZ), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) or obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It was not our intention to find every publication that matched our criteria, but rather, to reference a small collection of studies, meta-analyses or review papers (if available), to demonstrate that the relationship has been supported (Table 1)."

It has been recently demonstrated that while we are still in primitive development, vertigo appears to be one of the most basic types of feelings that can be transmitted via brainwave. Supposedly there is huge debate on if a very large amount of people can be targeted by this with many scientists claiming such a thing couldn’t exist. But proof it can be done on an individual direct level at least. Is it wild/outlandish to consider certain waves are causing vestibular issues within certain patients? Especially since we all have brainwaves that are unique enough to be used for biometrics? Surely that could mean some of us are particularly prone to certain wave/frequencies. I don’t think outright dismissing this theory as comical is the best approach as it appears to carry some merit. Snippet below from recent podcast.  I am trying to find out who she spoke to and what this device was.I realize the following is highly unethical, WEF is terrible, etc etc,… but from a Vestibular standpoint it would be beneficial to investigate this."

    "content": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9501247/ Increase in the cerebrospinal fluid content of neurosteroids in patients with unipolar major depression who are receiving fluoxetine or fluvoxamine We recently reported that fluoxetine or paroxetine, two selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), when administered to rats, increase the brain content of the neurosteroid 3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnane-20-one (3alpha5alpha-ALLO) without altering the brain content of other neurosteroids. ALLO (3alpha5alpha and 3alpha5beta isomers) binds with high affinity to various gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor A subtypes and facilitates the action of GABA at these receptors. We hypothesized that the increase of ALLO brain content induced by treatment with SSRIs could contribute to alleviating the anxiety and dysphoria associated with the symptomatology of major unipolar depression. We measured ALLO content in four cisternal-lumbar fractions of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) before and 8-10 weeks after treatment with fluoxetine or fluvoxamine in 15 patients with unipolar major depression. The concentration of ALLO ( approximately 40 fmol/ml in each CSF fraction of three control subjects) was about 60% lower in patients with major unipolar depression. However, in the same patients, fluoxetine or fluvoxamine treatment normalized the CSF ALLO content. Moreover, a statistically significant correlation (r = 0.58; P &lt; 0.023; n = 15) existed between symptomatology improvement (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores) and the increase in CSF ALLO after fluoxetine or fluvoxamine treatment. […] The normalization of CSF ALLO content in depressed patients appears to be sufficient to mediate the anxiolytic and antidysphoric actions of fluoxetine or fluvoxamine via its positive allosteric modulation of GABA type A receptors.https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7610857/ Role of glucocorticoid in vestibular compensation in relation to activation of vestibular nucleus neurons It is still not established whether or not glucocorticoids are effective in the treatment of vestibular disorders such as dizziness and imbalance, although these drugs in combination with several others are used to treat dizziness and imbalance in some diseases. This study was undertaken to investigate the effects of a glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, on vestibular disorder following unilateral labyrinthectomy in pigmented rabbits. Neuronal activities of the medial vestibular nucleus (MVN) in alpha-chloralose-anesthetized cats were also investigated. Systemic injection of dexamethasone decreased the frequency of nystagmus and head deviation dose-dependently following hemilabyrinthectomy, and the rate of decrease was faster than that obtained by saline. In contrast, RU38486 (a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist) delayed the reduction of nystagmus and head deviation. Micro-iontophoretic application of dexamethasone rapidly enhanced the spontaneous firing of MVN neurons in a dose-dependent manner. These increases were blocked by RU38486, but not by GDEE (a glutamate receptor antagonist) or Co2+ (a Ca2+ channel blocker). These results suggest that dexamethasone directly activates the MVN neurons, thereby accelerating vestibular compensation.https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30721178/ [The influence of corticosteroids on the frequency of vestibular crises] […] the adrenal glands in the patients suffering from Menière’s disease in its different clinical forms. We examined a total of 26 patients at the age from 29 to 47 years presenting with this condition. All the patients were divided into two groups depending on the character of the disease. Group 1 was comprised of 20 patients experiencing the crises from 2 to 6 times during a year. Group 2 was composed of six patients in whom the crises occurred with a frequency of 2-4 times per week within at least two weeks. The serum levels of cortisol and aldosterone were measured both during the crises and between them with the use of the proper immunoenzyme assays. The control group was formed of 20 practically healthy volunteers. It was shown that the blood cortisol level during a fit of dizziness in the patients of group 1 increased in comparison with that in the control subjects (798.7±71.2 nmol/l and 453.68±49.39 nmol/l respectively; p&lt;0.05). The patients having recurrent crises (group 2) experienced a significant decrease in the blood cortisol levels down to 293.5±38.1 nmol/l during a crisis in comparison with the control subjects (453.68±49.39 nmol/l; p&lt;0.05). During the inter-crisis periods , the blood cortisol level in the patients of the first group remained within normal bounds whereas in the patients of the second group its mean value was 18.7% lower (p&gt;0.05). The serum aldosterone level in the patients of the first group was not significantly different from that in the second group both during crises and in the periods of remission. It is concluded that the results of the study provide the data for the pathogenetic substantiation of the possibility for the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of the patients suffering from frequent crisis of Menière’s disease.https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30856424/ Attenuated cortisol reactivity to psychosocial stress is associated with greater visual dependency in postural control Despite known anatomical links between the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the vestibular system, there are no studies on the relationship between postural control and HPA axis function. Visual dependence in postural control, often measured by increased postural sway on exposure to visual motion, is an indication of altered visual-vestibular integration with greater weighting towards visual cues for balance. Visual dependence is more common in older age and a range of vestibular and non-vestibular health conditions. The relationship between visual dependence in postural control was investigated in relation to cortisol reactivity to psychosocial stress (using the Trier Social Stress Test for groups: TSST-G), as an index of HPA axis function, in healthy young females. In those who exhibited a cortisol response (&gt;2 nmol/l), a negative relationship between stress-induced cortisol reactivity and visual dependence in postural control was observed, since those with the largest cortisol response showed less visual motion induced postural sway (measured by force platform). This finding in healthy females indicates that subtle non-clinical differences in vestibular function are associated with dysregulated HPA axis activity as indicated by lower cortisol reactivity to psychosocial stress. It adds to the growing body of evidence linking blunted cortisol reactivity to stress to poor homeostatic regulation and potential negative health and behavioural outcomes.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3406321/ Interactions between Stress and Vestibular Compensation – A Review Elevated levels of stress and anxiety often accompany vestibular dysfunction, while conversely complaints of dizziness and loss of balance are common in patients with panic and other anxiety disorders. The interactions between stress and vestibular function have been investigated both in animal models and in clinical studies. Evidence from animal studies indicates that vestibular symptoms are effective in activating the stress axis, and that the acute stress response is important in promoting compensatory synaptic and neuronal plasticity in the vestibular system and cerebellum. The role of stress in human vestibular disorders is complex, and definitive evidence is lacking. This article reviews the evidence from animal and clinical studies with a focus on the effects of stress on the central vestibular pathways and their role in the pathogenesis and management of human vestibular disorders.While inner ear lesions often lead to vestibular and auditory deficits in parallel, the extent to which lesions in one system contribute to functional loss and adaptation in the other is at present largely unknown. For example, auditory cues are known to contribute to spatial orientation and balance function in sighted as well as congenitally blind people (Easton et al., 1998; Dozza et al., 2007), and thus auditory loss may beom animal studies has demonstrated neural pathways linking the vestibular nuclei with the limbic system including the hypothalamus and that stress responses evoked by vestibular symptoms promote synaptic and neuronal plasticity in the vestibular system. However in man conclusive evidence relating to the interactions between stress and vestibular system plasticity is lacking. In patients who remain poorly compensated following vestibular damage, clinical evidence implicates stress both as a causative agent and as a compounding factor that impedes compensation. In parallel the use of steroids in the treatment of acute vestibular symptoms also indicates a role for the acute stress response in facilitating vestibular compensation. Factors that tend to constrain a fuller understanding of the effects of stress in human vestibular disease include sometimes nebulous clinical definitions, difficult to measure endpoints whether clinical or physiological, and variations in the stress response between individuals and within the same individual over time. Nevertheless, the effects of stress on vestibular function and compensationStress axis activation facilitates vestibular compensation In the frog, hypophysectomy delays compensation after UVL while ACTH (4–10) administered post-UVL restores it (Flohr and Luneburg, 1982). In the squirrel monkey ACTH (4–10) given daily post-UVL (Igarashi et al., 1985) and following a two – staged bilateral vestibular labyrinthectomy (Ishii and Igarashi, 1987) was found to improve vestibular compensation. In the guinea pig administration of methylprednisolone (Jerram et al., 1995) and ACTH (4–10; Gilchrist et al., 1990) after UVL were found to improve vestibular compensation while dexamethasone had no effect (Alice et al., 1998). The synthetic ACTH (4–9) fragment (Org 2766) was also shown to improve vestibular compensation following UVL when administered peripherally (Gilchrist et al., 1994) or directly into the MVN (Gilchrist et al., 1996). In the rabbit vestibular compensation improved with dexamethasone administration in a dose-dependent manner, and was delayed following administration of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist RU38486 (Yamanaka et al., 1995b). In the rat RU38486 prevented the increase in intrinsic electrophysiological excitability that takes place in ipsi-lesional MVN neurons after UVL, while dexamethasone administration restored it (Cameron and Dutia, 1999; Johnston et al., 2002). The effects of dexamethasone were observed when it was micro-injected into the ipsi-lesional cerebellar flocculus, indicating that the cerebellum is one site of action for GR activation (Johnston et al., 2002). Excessive stress can impair compensationIn addition, neurosteroids can significantly modulate GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission in the MVN. Pregnanolone sulfate and DHEAS reduce GABA receptor efficacy and thus enhance neuronal activity (Yamamoto et al., 1998a,b), while 20-hydroxyecdysone increases GABA activity thus inhibiting neuronal excitability (Okada et al., 1998). Pregnanolone sulfate modulates glutamate receptors and increases MVN neuron activity (Yamamoto et al., 1998b). Tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone and allopregnanolone also modulate MVN neuronal activity by their actions on GABA and AMPA/kainate receptors (Grassi et al., 2007), while 17 β-estradiol modulates MVN activity by increasing excitatory glutamatergic transmission and reducing GABAergic transmission (Grassi et al., 2009a,b, 2010). These various effects represent a potent and hitherto largely uncharacterized mechanism that regulates the function of the vestibular neural networks. These modulatory effects are likely to be important both in the normal state with basal levels of circulating stress hormones, and the stressed state with elevated levels of stress hormones. In addition, such endocrine modulatory control may mediate the effects of estrogens in menstruating women and potentially explain the increasingly apparent links between the menstrual cycle and the susceptibility to motion sickness, dizziness, and migrainous vertigo (Grassi et al., 2009a).Stress and Vestibular Compensation in Man Dagilas et al. (2005) investigated the stress response evoked by vestibular stimulation in healthy volunteers by measuring serum cortisol levels at the point of maximal nystagmus while undergoing caloric stimulation. Cortisol levels were found to be significantly elevated above resting levels, while the serum concentrations of glutamate, glycine, and GABA were reduced (Dagilas et al., 2005). In a preceding detailed study, Kohl (1985) demonstrated that cross-angular rotatory vestibular stimulation potently stimulated ACTH, noradrenaline, and adrenaline secretion, in a pattern consistent with a vestibular-evoked stress response. Interestingly while this effect was seen in all subjects, individuals with a low susceptibility to motion sickness had higher baseline levels of ACTH as well as a significantly larger response following rotation (Kohl, 1985). The finding that individual stress response profiles may be correlated with the adaptability to stressful motion stimuli (Kohl, 1985) also suggests that in patients with vestibular lesions, the stress response evoked by vestibular deafferentation may be related to their adaptability to the vestibular symptoms, and could influence the subsequent development of vestibular compensation.Stress responsiveness and compensation in clinical practice Vestibular stressors may present either in the form of a single acute episode as in vestibular neuritis, a vascular event or surgical deafferentation, or chronic repeated episodes such as in Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV), Meniere’s disease, or migrainous vertigo. If the process of vestibular compensation is inadequate, the underlying dysfunction may persist and eventually present as chronic dizziness (Bronstein et al., 2010). Thus the nature of the stress response in individual patients is likely to vary according to the underlying dysfunction, with an acute episode of vertigo in vestibular neuritis that gradually subsides having a different stress response profile compared with the unpredictable episodes in patients with Meniere’s disease or migrainous vertigo, or the chronic dizziness of the poorly compensated patient.Chronic stress and the poorly compensated patient Horii et al. (2007) reported elevated cortisol levels in dizzy patients with neurootological diagnoses compared with those in a group of patients with idiopathic dizziness, whereas plasma AVP levels were found to be elevated in both groups* (Horii et al., 2007). Takeda et al. (1995) also reported high AVP levels in patients during an acute attack of Meniere’s disease** (Takeda et al., 1995). van Cruijsen et al. (2005) reported significantly elevated serum and salivary cortisol levels in Meniere’s patients compared with healthy controls (van Cruijsen et al., 2005). Horner and Cazals (2005) assessed cortisol and ACTH in patientshttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7596253/ Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo Risk Factors Unique to Perimenopausal Women Many investigations have found common occurrences of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) in women, and clinical experience has shown that BPPV can develop due to increased hormonal fluctuations, especially during menopause. Therefore, knowledge about neurochemicals and their involvement with BPPV is imperative for the management of neurological issues in women. This review will discuss appropriate gender-based considerations of BPPV based on experimental and clinical evidence. The studies describe 2 lines of evidence regarding the association of perimenopause in women and the development of BPPV: (1) experimental evidence: the existence of estrogen receptors in the inner ear, otoconial malformations in osteopenic/osteoporotic rats, changes in otoconin 90 caused by hormone replacement therapy, and impaired calcium absorption following estrogen deprivation corrected by estrogen replacement therapy and (2) clinical evidence: epidemiological aspects, osteoporosis and estrogen deficiency. Future studies are necessary to validate the effects of hormonal replacement therapy and phytoestrogen in women with recurrent BPPV. Keywords: vertigo, estrogen, women, otoconia, perimenopauseKnown as the most common cause of recurrent vertigo (1), benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is an important health problem affecting more than 420 million adults worldwide, based on an international consensus that BPPV has a lifetime prevalence of 10% (2). BPPV increases with age, especially during menopause, in a ratio of 2-3.2:1 for women and men aged 40–60 years (3–8). In particular, hormonal changes, external estrogens, and pregnancy exposure are only experienced by women. Further understanding of possible contributors to the predominance of BPPV in women could make a significant contribution to our understanding of the causes of BPPV and may provide new methods for prevention. Therefore, the present study will review the current state of knowledge on BPPV risk factors specific to women.Perimenopause Period There are three stages of perimenopause in the executive summary of the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop: “early menopausal transition (early perimenopause), characterized by irregularities in the menstrual cycle, late menopausal transition (late perimenopause), characterized by an interval of more than 60 days of amenorrhea in the previous 12 months; and early postmenopause, which is the first year following the last menstrual period (9).” Physiologically, estrogen declines sharply during this period, which occurs over several years and is characterized by marked fluctuations in sex hormone levels. The fluctuations during this period are more severe than those during the menstrual cycle (10). Regarding personal aspects, menopause occurs during the time in life when women are actively involved in raising a family and/or full-time work, during which time women may also be responsible for caring for elderly parents. Most menopausal women experience uncomfortable symptoms, and menopause is related to an increased risk for metabolic syndrome, in addition to obesity and osteoporosis (11). In the field of gynecology, menopausal symptoms are assessed using the “Kupperman rating scale” (Table 1) (12–14). The inclusion of vertigo items in one menopausal symptom index suggests that vertigo is also a frequent complaint in gynecology clinics. Although the nature of vertigo has not been precisely elucidated, postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) was superior to placebo when assessed by the “Kupperman scale including the item addressing vertigo (15).” Additionally, many neurotology studies have shown an increased incidence of BPPV in women, and experience with older people suggests that hormonal fluctuations, particularly during menopause, may increase, resulting in the development of BPPV (3–8). Cooperative management between neurotologists and gynecologists could be helpful in the management of dizziness in women who experienceExperimental Evidence Anatomical Differences Differences in the peripheral vestibular system between men and women have been reported. To our knowledge, no reports have described the direct comparison of otoconial morphology between women and men. However, in the anteroposterior dimension, the width of the peripheral vestibular system is significantly smaller in women (16), which could suggest a difference in otoconial morphology, such as differences in the bones according to sex. Further validation studies are needed. Hormone Changes Physiologically, testosterone levels are more stable than estrogen levels throughout a woman’s life and are relatively constant at ages 30–70 (17). Estrogen decreases steeply during the climacteric period. The female sex hormone estrogen 17β-estradiol (E2) is well-known to perform many tasks and contributes to various roles, such as reproductive organ differentiation and function, memory processes and bone metabolism (18, 19). Clinically, E2 and progesterone levels are clearly reduced in women with BPPV (20, 21); however, no difference in testosterone was found between the postmenopausal and control groups (21). Similar to other sex steroids, estrogen acts on target cells by attaching to nuclear hormone receptors such as estrogen receptor (ER)α and β (22). Thus, the ER level is an important determinant that influences estrogen signaling to the cell.Estrogen and Vitamin D Recent reports have shown that reduced serum levels of vitamin D are associated with the occurrence of BPPV (4, 35–40), and supplementation of vitamin D with/without calcium reduces recurrent events in BPPV patients (41–44). Estrogen treatment prevents the loss of intestinal Ca2+ absorption and bone density caused by ovariectomy in the premenopausal period (45). Experimental studies have shown that impaired Ca2+ absorption following estrogen deprivation is caused by a decreased response to 1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol, the main regulator of intestinal absorption, and that estrogen treatment, rather than short-term replacement with 1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol, can amend this abnormality. Therefore, combined hormone replacement and vitamin D management could be more effective for the prevention of further attacks of vertigo in perimenopausal women with BPPV. However, further validation studies are needed (45). Clinical Evidence Susceptibility of Women to BPPV Several factors increase the susceptibility to BPPV, including older age, head and neck trauma, inactivity, and other ear problems or surgery. Many studies have shown a common occurrence in women, and clinical experience with older people has shown that BPPV can develop due to increased hormonal fluctuations, especially during menopause (3–8). BPPV and Oral Contraceptives A previous study reported that recurrent BPPV was related to oral contraceptives (46). It has been postulated that oral contraceptives may induce disturbances in the water and electrolyte balance, variances in endolymph pH and abnormalities in carbohydrate or lipid metabolism, which may cause otoconial degeneration and subsequent otoconial detachment and BPPV (46).Hormone Replacement Therapy HRT to combat estrogen depletion in menopause has also been successfully used to treat vasomotor symptoms and is assumed to be neuroprotective compared to women not using HRT. Although the nature of vertigo has not been precisely elucidated, women using postmenopausal HRT had better scores than the placebo group on the “Kupperman scale” (sweating, hot flashes, myalgia, and vertigo) (15). The hormonal fluctuation of ovarian neurosteroids might trigger the occurrence/recurrence of BPPV during the perimenopausal period. In the Taiwanese population, a study revealed that the incidence of BPPV was significantly lower in patients taking estrogen for menopausal syndrome in two age groups (ages 45–65 and ages 65 and over) (6). These findings support the efficacy of estrogen supplementation to decrease the occurrence of BPPV in women with menopause. The possible mechanisms include complete, more reliable estrogen blood levels that induce protective effects, estrogen effects on autophagy and possible epigenetic modulation (5, 6, 20, 63). However, chronic use of HRT increases the risk of breast cancer (64), stroke (64), and venous thrombosis. Therefore, many postmenopausal women rely on other non-steroidal estrogen mimetics or natural remedies to solve the problems associated with the symptoms of estrogen deficiency. Phytoestrogen could be an alternative to HRT. Phytoestrogens, including soy isoflavones, are non-steroidal, diphenolic substances that can bind to ERs and have activity similar to that of estrogen (65). To date, there have been no reports on the effectiveness of phytoestrogens on BPPV recurrence.https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28480516/ Estradiol deficiency is a risk factor for idiopathic benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in postmenopausal female patients Objectives/hypothesis: Although it is generally considered that benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is associated with changes in female sex hormone levels, no direct data have been reported until now. The purpose of this article was to provide direct data showing the distinct relationship between female sex hormone fluctuations and BPPV in postmenopausal female patients. Study design: Prospective analysis in humans and basic research in animals. Methods: Blood samples were analyzed to determine the levels of estradiol, progesterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone in 50- to 80-year-old postmenopausal female patients newly diagnosed with idiopathic BPPV based on history compatible with BPPV and positive provocative maneuvers. Animal models of bilateral ovariectomy and female sex hormone replacement therapy were used to further confirm the relationship between BPPV and female sex hormone levels by determining the expression levels of otoconin 90, the protein suggested as essential in the dislocation of otoconia. Results: Statistically significant differences between the estradiol level of BPPV patients and the control group were found (P &lt; .001). Moreover, in bilateral ovariectomy in rats, 17β-estradiol replacement reversed the decrease of otoconin 90 levels. Conclusions: Our results suggest that estradiol deficiency may be an important risk factor for idiopathic benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in postmenopausal female patients.https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35398289/ Serum estradiol correlates with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in postmenopausal women Results: 86 postmenopausal women with BPPV and 80 age- and demographics and clinical characteristics-matched normal postmenopausal women were enrolled. Decreased E2, increased otolin-1, and decreased BMD were observed in postmenopausal women with BPPV, and increased BMD and decreased otolin-1 could be observed in higher serum E2 patients. ROC analysis revealed that E2, otolin-1, and BMD showed low sensitivity and moderate specificity to discriminate the occurrence of BPPV. On the other hand, low correlation coefficient was found between E2 and otolin-1, or BMD. It was worth noting that low E2 level was found in the relapse BPPV patients after a one-year follow-up. Conclusion: E2 deficiency is correlated with the occurrence of BPPV, which may be a potential risk biomarker for postmenopausal women.https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20443014/ Effects of estradiol-drospirenone hormone treatment on carotid artery intima-media thickness and vertigo/dizziness in postmenopausal women Abstract Aim: To investigate the effects of Angeliq on hormonal, metabolic, biochemical and cardiovascular profile, carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and vertigo/dizziness symptoms in postmenopausal women. Methods: Angeliq is a drug used for hormone replacement therapy that composed of drospirenone 2 mg and estradiol 1 mg. Thirty-two postmenopausal women were recruited for the study. All women were evaluated using personal interview, medical examination and carotid artery ultrasound. They were questioned specifically about vertigo/dizziness experienced. Participants were randomly submitted to oral daily treatment with Angeliq. The duration of the study was 6 months and the participants were studied in basal condition and after 6 months of the therapy. Results: Follicle-stimulating hormone was significantly higher and estradiol was significantly lower in before therapy (BT) than in after therapy (AT) (p &lt; 0.001). No differences in fasting glucose, CRP and WBC values, and lipid-lipoprotein profile were detected between the groups. The systolic and diastolic blood pressures and heart rate were also significantly higher in BT than in AT (p &lt; 0.05). A significant (p &lt; 0.001) difference in CIMT (0.51 ± 0.04 vs. 0.49 ± 0.03 mm) was found between BT and AT. Seven of 32 patients (22%) had vertigo/dizziness symptoms before treatment. After 6 months, none of the patients showed complaints of vertigo/dizziness. Conclusions: Oral daily treatment with Angeliq reduces CIMT and climacteric complaints including vertigo/dizziness in postmenopausal women. They may relate to anti-androgenic and anti-mineralocorticoid effects of Angeliq, respectively.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6430344/ 2019 Correlation between auditory‐vestibular functions and estrogen levels in postmenopausal patients with Meniere’s disease Results A total of 76 postmenopausal patients with MD and 50 healthy postmenopausal controls were included. The patients with MD had lower estrogen levels (22.50 ± 16.66 pg/mL vs 30.69 ± 18.59 pg/mL, P = 0.011), longer I‐V interpeak latency of ABR (left 0.22 ± 0.16 mseconds vs 0.18 ± 0.10 mseconds, P = 0.118; right 0.24 ± 0.13 mseconds vs 0.17 ± 0.09 mseconds, P = 0.001), and higher unilateral weakness (UW) value (P &lt; 0.001) in comparison with the controls. The mean pure‐tone thresholds of at the speech frequency (500 Hz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz, and 3 kHz) were significantly elevated in patients with MD than those in the controls (left P &lt; 0.001, right P &lt; 0.01). The estradiol level of patients with MD was correlated with ABR latency (left r = −0.229, P &lt; 0.05; right r = −0.220, P &lt; 0.05) and UW value (r = −0.328, P &lt; 0.05), but not with mean pure‐tone threshold. Conclusions Estrogen levels correlated with auditory and vestibular function in postmenopausal patients with MD. Low estrogen may be involved in the microcirculatory disturbance of the inner ear, affecting the occurrence and development of MD.https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34024170/ Clinical significance of serum sex hormones in postmenopausal women with vestibular migraine: potential role of estradiol Results: Serum levels of estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone were significantly lower, while serum prolactin levels were significantly higher in postmenopausal patients with vestibular migraine compared with healthy controls. Serum estradiol levels were negatively correlated with the duration, frequency, and severity of onset of vestibular migraine. Patients with higher serum estradiol levels showed a longer disease-free survival time. Conclusion: Sex hormones are correlated with vestibular migraine in postmenopausal women. Additionally, estradiol levels are correlated with the duration, frequency, and severity of onset of vestibular migraine, as well as the disease-free survival time.https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28534686/ 2017 HASHIMOTO THYROIDITIS AND VESTIBULAR DYSFUNCTION Objective: The aim of this review was to analyze the existing literature concerning the relationship between Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) and vestibular dysfunction. Methods: We used electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library) to search and collect all published articles about the association between HT and vestibular disorders. Results: Several observational and retrospective studies have postulated a relationship between thyroid autoimmunity and vestibular disorders. In most cases, an appropriate control group was lacking, and the impact of thyroid functional status could not precisely be established. In recent years, two well-designed prospective studies have provided convincing evidence that the association is not random. One article reported that patients with Ménière disease (MD) had a significantly higher prevalence of positive anti-thyroid autoantibody as compared to healthy controls. Moreover, more than half of MD patients had either positive anti-thyroid or non-organ-specific autoantibody titers, compared to less than 30% of both patients with unilateral vestibular paresis without cochlear involvement and healthy controls. Another study found that patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) had significantly higher serum thyroid-stimulating hormone and antithyroid autoantibody levels than healthy controls. Additionally, almost one-fifth of euthyroid patients with HT had signs of BPPV. Conclusion: The published results indicate that patients with MD or BPPV are potential candidates to also develop HT. Thus, in HT patients, the presence of even slight symptoms or signs potentially related to vestibular lesions should be carefully investigated.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4948427/ Incidence of Hypothyroidism in Meniere’s Disease Materials and Methods The study was carried out on total 35 out patients who were clinically diagnosed of Meniere’s disease and of these 35 patients, 12 patients were found to have hypothyroidism. All patients with hypothyroidism were treated with oral thyroxin supplements and they were evaluated clinically at 3 weeks, 3 months and 6 months interval for the improvement in subjective symptoms on outpatient basis. Results In our study, the subjective improvement of all symptoms was seen in all cases of Meniere’s disease with hypothyroidism after 12 weeks of treatment. Conclusion The improvement in clinical symptoms after treatment demonstrates an association between Meniere’s disease and hypothyroidism which was found to be significant. Hence, clinicians should consider screening patients with Meniere disease for thyroid dysfunction who are not already taking supplements.https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23906822/ Vertigo and metabolic disorders Material and method: The study evaluates the metabolic profile of 325 patients with vertigo who sought the Otolaryngology Department of the University of São Paulo in the Hospital das Clínicas da Universidade de São Paulo. The laboratory tests ordered according to the classical research protocol were: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol fraction, TSH, T3, T4 and fasting blood sugar level. The metabolic disorders found and the ones that were observed in the general population were compared. The high level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, the altered levels of thyroid hormones, the higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus were the most significant changes found in the group of study.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5733003/ The Role of Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1 in the Progression of Age-Related Hearing Loss Aging is associated with impairment of sensorial functions and with the onset of neurodegenerative diseases. As pari passu circulating insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) bioavailability progressively decreases, we see a direct correlation with sensory impairment and cognitive performance in older humans. Age-related sensory loss is typically caused by the irreversible death of highly differentiated neurons and sensory receptor cells. Among sensory deficits, age-related hearing loss (ARHL), also named presbycusis, affects one third of the population over 65 years of age and is a major factor in the progression of cognitive problems in the elderly. The genetic and molecular bases of ARHL are largely unknown and only a few genes related to susceptibility to oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and cell death have been identified. IGF-1 is known to be a neuroprotective agent that maintains cellular metabolism, activates growth, proliferation and differentiation, and limits cell death. Inborn IGF-1 deficiency leads to profound sensorineural hearing loss both in humans and mice. IGF-1 haploinsufficiency has also been shown to correlate with ARHL. There is not much information available on the effect of IGF-1 deficiency on other human sensory systems, but experimental models show a long-term impact on the retina. A secondary action of IGF-1 is the control of oxidative stress and inflammation, thus helping to resolve damage situations, acute or made chronic by aging. Here we will review the primary actions of IGF-1 in the auditory system and the underlying molecular mechanisms. […]Regarding the aforementioned mechanisms, IGF-1 is a neurotrophic factor with anti-inflammatory actions. It is anti-apoptotic and favors cell renewal.In this context, IGF-1 emerges as a potential protector of the inner ear. Studies in animal models have shown that local application of recombinant human IGF-1 (rhIGF-I) protects the cochlea from functional and histologic losses induced by aminoglycoside ototoxicity and noise exposure (Iwai et al., 2006; Yamahara et al., 2015). IGF-1 rescued hair cells from apoptosis by downregulating pro-apoptotic gene expression and regulating glucose transporters (Yamahara et al., 2015). Similarly, IGF-1 and substance P protect vestibular hair cells against neomycin ototoxicity (Yoshida et al., 2015).https://ejnpn.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41983-018-0042-y Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 in Acute Ischemic Stroke Cerebrovascular ischemic stroke is highly prevalent in the general population and is considered one of the frequent causes of mortality and disability. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is recognized as an important neuro-protective factor against cerebral vascular ischemic insult. Patients and methods Two hundred patients with AIS (within the first 24 h) were subjected to full neurological examination, assessment of stroke severity using National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and measurement of serum IGF-1 levels. The control group included 100 subjects matched for age, gender, and conventional vascular risk factors. Results Serum IGF-1 levels were significantly reduced in cases of first AIS compared to control group. A reduced serum IGF-1 level was an independent risk factor for ischemic stroke with cut off value less than 148.3 ng/ml associated with increased AIS risk. Conclusion Lower IGF-1 levels are significantly related to risk of ischemic stroke occurrence, independent from other conventional risk factors in the Egyptian population.https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17927668/ The relevance of an elevation in the plasma vasopressin levels to the pathogenesis of Meniere’s attack An elevation of plasma vasopressin levels has been frequently observed in Meniere’s disease patients. However, little is known regarding the mechanism behind this elevation. The plasma vasopressin levels and plasma osmolality were therefore determined in 18 diagnosed Meniere’s disease patients and 20 patients with other types of vertigo, who required admission for severe vertigo attacks. All participants were given questionnaires regarding their clinical and psychological status, including their stress levels and depression status, to evaluate environmental stress events. The plasma vasopressin levels of Meniere’s disease patients in the acute phase (4.1 +/- 1.37 pg/ml) were significantly higher compared with with those of other vertigo patients in the acute phase (2.1 +/- 0.41 pg/ml) (P &lt; 0.01). The average plasma osmolality of the Meniere’s disease group was higher than that of the other vertigo patients group (P &lt; 0.05). No significant difference in reported stress levels, depression status and prevalence of primary headache between the groups was observed. The plasma vasopressin showed no significant correlation with the patients’ clinical data (occurrence of emesis or nausea, prevalence of primary headache, depression status and stress). No correlation between the plasma vasopressin and the plasma osmolarity was observed in the Meniere’s disease group. These results suggest that the elevation of plasma vasopressin in the acute phase of Meniere’s disease is therefore related to the pathogenesis of Meniere’s attacks, and the results obtained may provide helpful information for distinguishing between Meniere’s disease and other various inner ear diseases.https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27362705/ 2016 A Two-Year Randomized Trial of Interventions to Decrease Stress Hormone Vasopressin Production in Patients with Meniere’s Disease-A Pilot Study Meniere’s disease, a common inner ear condition, has an incidence of 15-50 per 100,000. Because mental/physical stress and subsequent increase in the stress hormone vasopressin supposedly trigger Meniere’s disease, we set a pilot study to seek new therapeutic interventions, namely management of vasopressin secretion, to treat this disease. We enrolled 297 definite Meniere’s patients from 2010 to 2012 in a randomized-controlled and open-label trial, assigning Group-I (control) traditional oral medication, Group-II abundant water intake, Group-III tympanic ventilation tubes and Group-IV sleeping in darkness. Two hundred sixty-three patients completed the planned 2-year-follow-up, which included assessment of vertigo, hearing, plasma vasopressin concentrations and changes in stress/psychological factors. At 2 years, vertigo was completely controlled in 54.3% of patients in Group-I, 81.4% in Group-II, 84.1% in Group-III, and 80.0% in Group-IV (statistically I &lt; II = III = IV). Hearing was improved in 7.1% of patients in Group-I, 35.7% in Group-II, 34.9% in Group-III, and 31.7% in Group-IV (statistically I &lt; II = III = IV). Plasma vasopressin concentrations decreased more in Groups-II, -III, and -IV than in Groups-I (statistically I &lt; II = III = IV), although patients’ stress/psychological factors had not changed. Physicians have focused on stress management for Meniere’s disease. However, avoidance of stressis unrealistic for patients who live in demanding social environments. Our findings in this pilot study suggest that interventions to decrease vasopressin secretion by abundant water intake, tympanic ventilation tubes and sleeping in darkness is feasible in treating Meniere’s disease, even though these therapies did not alter reported mental/physical stress levels.Promising drugs: - Piribedil - Fluvoxamine, study on vertigo where improvement is made, potential increase in GABA-A agonism which could be beneficial as per diazepam. - Sodium bicarbonate [tentative], used in Asia - Angeliq, postmenopausal HRT, estradiol and a type of progestin. Tried for a type of vertigo directly, but estradiol seems to be the more important hormone in general for all the disorders. Intravaginal progesterone potentially has fewer side effects than the other/oral progestins. Value of progesterone as a whole uncertain. - GH/IGF-1 protective for inner ear. Leaving that aside, low IGF-1 is a risk factor for stroke, and poor prognosis/recovery. There seems to be a connection between low estradiol/vitamin D/calcium and low density/abnormalities of the otoconia, and an association with low BMD. If this is a solid connection then GH should be useful as well. - Vasopressin interventions as per the MD study - or a V2 antagonist as per https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26719142/ - relevant only for MD. - Hydrocortisone/prednisone/dexamethasone - Seems important for vestibular compensation. Patients with MD who had only a handful of attacks per year show a robust cortisol response to vertigo. Patients with several attacks per week show a very blunted response. In animal studies, removal of the pituitary gland worsens vestibular compensation but synthetic ACTH administration restores it. A study on rabbits shows a dose dependent improvement with dexamethasone, worsening with GR antagonist. - Treat hypothyroidism if present, very common in vestibular disordersAmphetamines improve tolerance to stimulation with rotations [163]. The use of amphetamines in combination with scopolamine or antihistaminics increased the antivertiginous effect and reduced the secondary sedation produced by antihistaminics and anticholinergic drugs. Ephedrine seems to be as effective as amphetamines in increasing the effectiveness of drugs used for the control of movement disease, but without the addictive potential of amphetamines. The application of dopamine (0.1-1 mM) and D1 and D2 agonists induced a dose-dependent and reversible decline in the resting discharge frequency of vestibular afferents in the isolated frog vestibule [6]. The responses of afferent neurons to EAA agonists were inhibited by D1 and D2 agonists, implicating both subtypes of dopamine receptors in the modulation of both ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors. The results obtained suggest that dopamine may interact with both D1 and D2 receptor subtypes that are most likely located postsynaptically on the afferent neurons, where they may form part of the efferent control of vestibular input [6]. These findings coincide with those of previous studies that indicate the participation of catecholamines in vestibular neurotransmission [47] and contribute to understanding the mechanism of action of dopaminergic-related drugs, such as droperidol, in the treatment of vestibular disorders. In fact, sulpiride, which is a selective antagonist at postsynaptic D2 receptors, has been used as a “vestibular sedative”.”‘The activation of Mu-opioid receptors on afferent neurons potentiates the action of excitatory amino acids, increasing the afferent activity [156]. ‘"

    "content": "I seem to already be predispositioned to issues with medications.  Especially to medications that use Cyp2c19 (A,A)High amount of studies + rare in N. America (common in Asia 30%?)Nonetheless I’ve been told to not put much weight in these studies from quite a few medical professionals so I suppose it’s all just my hypothetical ramblings.disclaimer: this is just one of many variants that could effect metabolism of medications that use cyp2c19.Medications I’ve triedYMMV . My current set of issues can influence how medications affect me much differently than someone with a different set of symptoms. Poor drug metabolism is also a factor here. I am also aware that some of these effects can be attributed to the ‘nocebo’ or ‘placebo’ effect, and they can even be influenced by what you ate that day. However, the side effects I experienced or assumed were so strong at times that I am wary about trying it again and have a fear of medications. Obviously I still tried as the list below shows. Also I’ve never had the ability to take more than a few days away from work so I often had to stop treatment if I couldn’t be bedridden for very long.  Benadryloccasionally very sick next day , flu like symptomsinfoMy Dr at the time had told me it's ok to use this nightly as a sleep aid but I eventually realized it was dramatically increasing my symptoms so I stoppped. MeclizineHave sublingual tabs that reduce about 20%, definitely not great for severe attacks, the pills don’t seem to be as effective eitherinfo These can work pretty fast and more efficiently than the pills     HydroxyzineThese do seem to make me drowsy, and reduce some anxiety, but it causes an increase in attacks if I take it too often.info It's technically an antihistamine but has anti anxiety properties for some patients. I actually took it briefly many years ago and it made me feel really weird. This time around I tried it again and it seemed to work better. 10mg is often all that's needed to get drowsy but during an attack I may take upwards of 50 to 75mg. I think 100 is the max but can still extend beyond that. For a while I was taking it all day during a bad attack (like 10mg every hour until I was calm again) and I think it was causing substantially increased rebound anxiety as it wore off. It does seem to dramatically reduce my blood pressure and heart rate. I already have issues with hypotension so lowering it more also may have been causing increased anxiety. I would usually sleep on it, but the after effects still had that vital lowering effect for a whole day after.  DimenhydrinateMild sedative even in larger doses for me, increases symptomsinfo These are often sold as dramamine. I always got carsick so that mixed with my autonomic issues at the time made long trips terrible. I decided to keep it on me during a recent trip just in case. 5hr car ride, -10f, little sleep and we made it to the hotel. I took an elevator up 8 floors to my room. The elevator sensation never stopped for me. Constant falling sensation. I took a dramamine, tried to ignore it, and went back down the elevator to have dinner. Middle of dinner I felt like I was going to faint. Tried to escape but didn't make it and fainted in front of the entire restaurant. Caused a scene since I went into convulsions. EMT called. Spent rest of my vacation in my room vomiting. Thank you dramamine.    Theoretically now I assume my blood pressure was low and it dropped it even lower making me highly susceptible to fainting. I was still quite new to my issues at the time.  Doxylamine succinateEffective sleeping medicine, fast tolerance, mild hangover effectinfo I notice these are one of the few otc sleeping pills I can somewhat handle. I noticed this when I realized I could handle nyquil fine and this is a main ingredient. It seems like unisom is the main manufacturer of this. I prefer to have a liquid version since I don't like taking even a small amount more than I should, just enough to drift to sleep. I don't know what the long term consequences are of these in particular. Cholinergics theoretically linked to dementia. But I also know without sleep, I lose my job and my mind.    BetahistineIncreased GI issues, mild relief of vertigoinfo This was suggested to me by others with similar issues. It appears to be commonly prescribed in other countries for vertigo but not approved in the states. I took other totally very legal means of acquiring this to try it.   I started with half a dose but it didn't seem to do anything so gradually increased to full dose. It did seem to almost dull the sensation of vertigo a bit. Like it was holding the middle ear down with static. But just barely and the GI symptoms I had from it didn't go away with time. It also can counteract some antihistamines which I rely on occasionally so it was not worth it to me.  OndansetronCauses a headache, but effective anti nausea med.info  AcetaminophenNo obvious side effects, but also very low efficacyinfo Since this is low efficacy and it's rare for me to have a fever, I usually don't take this very often. Alternative if you have issues with NSAIDs so I'm trying to not ruin my gut on NSAIDs to begin with so I don't have only this to rely on. IbuprofenGI issues if too often, but effective pain reliefinfo This is actually pretty decent for pain in most cases, although I've had it not come through for me in rare moments. Caution does need to be exercised with this, however, as it reduces the mucus you generate in your stomach, hence the advice to eat with it. I do my best to stay at 200mg, only taking it if my pain is so bad that I can't work, sleep, or am fainting... and not more than a few days in a row. Rebound occurs anyway      NaproxenTried for cramps, headaches, muscle aches. Doesn’t work?info I honestly haven't figured out what this even helps with so far. It's another NSAID too so definitely not worth it for me. CBDOccasionally works for pain and anxiety, but often not at all.info THC increases my vertigo (sad days) but it seems like a little bit is needed for CBD to be more pronounced. Still seems too low at the federal limit anyways. I've tried various reputable oils and balms. Very hit or miss. I wonder if I just don't metabolize it most of the time. Sometimes it works great. Since there's practically no issues with safety I always give it a shot to see if it will work for something mild. PropranololMade my BP crash; caused more anxietyinfo I already have issues with low BP so this wasn't a good mix. I went in prepared for that though so maybe I was setting myself up to fail. I even tried it for performance anxiety. It's supposed to stop all your physical symptoms. It kind of did... but not mentally, then I fainted. TopamaxDaily panic attacks first week, was told to stop itinfo I really wanted this to work. At the time I was desparate and just wanted something to work. I was in a state of constant high anxiety and panic. I would just sit on the floor shaking, sweating, delerious. and my boyfriend at the time told me I probably should stop them but I was determined to \"get used to it\". I called my new Dr at the time and he told me to stop them. Since I felt so awful it was hard to argue with that but I wonder why he would tell me to stop over something like that when my last doctor got mad that I wanted to stop over sudden paralysis? Wild ProgesteroneCream and pill ; dramatically increased vertigo, couldn’t stick with itinfo Really wanted this to work. Severe attacks almost always have occured during hormonal shifts within my cycle. I couldn't handle it anymore. Even the smallest spike sent me into a cluster of attacks. Maybe I'll try this when I'm a bit older as hormonal balances change often.  DepoBled for 8 months straight, increase in all symptoms, almost lost jobinfo I remember long ago getting on this hoping it would stop my period but instead it made me sick for months and my period never stopped. I called the office about this and they told me 'just give it more time'. I didn't continue the series as I would have been homeless without an income. If it got any worse I would have had to stop working.    AzithromycinTemporarily stopped all symptoms for 2 weeks, gradual return to baselineinfo I was actually pretty nervous to take this but within 3hrs all of my symptoms disappeared. It stayed like this until 2 weeks after the last dose. One of the first 'this can't be a placebo' moments I've ever had because it was like a heavy fog had lifted from me and I had never felt that clear headed since before I got sick.  I've told multiple doctors about this and most just give it the eyebrow raise and continue with stanadard treatment layout.  I was given another round by my pcp however but it wasn't as effective I assume since it was less than a year from my last dose. Also would like to avoid constant abx use for obvious reasons.  CiproIntense joint pains and increased feverinfo This was a long time ago so it's hard to accurately document what happened. Back when I used to just take what's given to me without hesitation or question. I remember not being able to finish it and it costing me more days from work as it made me even more sick and immobile with joint pain. I probably should have finished it, I remember I had like 2 left and really needed to get back to work.   MetronidazoleKept throwing up the pills, high amounts of abdominal paininfo Little embarrassed about why I had to take this but what it was resolving just wasn't worth the pain. Made all my symptoms worse. EscitalopramSudden complete paralysis and intense fear, stomach problems, fever, sweating, diarhhea, tremblinginfo This was  the worst reaction I've ever had to any substance ever. I'm not convinced this was nocebo at all in the slightest. This was a gradual worsening until the attack. I'm not sure why. Either it's because I can't excrete it and it builds up then releases in my blood stream all at once.. or it caused my already low electrolytes to bottom out. Dr at the time was upset I didn't want to continue.   AmitryptilineCan’t handle doses over 25mg but will hit tolerance and just have to stop, helps sleep and appetite,info I was actually on this for a long time. The side effects were mild and some actually beneficial. It did nothing for my vertigo and slightly even increased positional tachycardia but I was sleeping 12hrs a day, barely awake when I was up, and eating more. Before I started it, I was sleep deprived and having issues keeping food down. I also liked not being conscious.. a lot. I remember I was not doing a good job at work and didn't even care. I hit tolerance but started getting headaches if I increased my dose past 25mg. So I had to stop them. Might return someday since tolerance is reset. It's a good medication to kind of stop me from losing my mind. AlbuterolNo issues. I don’t use this unless I feel like I’m dyinginfo After a respiratory illness I was having issues waking up feeling like my diaphragm was paralyzed and not being able to take a breath for a minute before finally catching my breath. I was told to try PPIs even though I felt no heartburn. I requested an inhaler should it happen again and it did help a bit. I only use it during respriratory infections now. OmeprazoleBack pain, increased abdominal issuesinfo I tried these for a bit but they didn't help my shortness of breath attacks much plus added new problems.  HydrocodoneEffective pain reliever, only used onceinfo I forgot when I last tried this but remember it working really well. I've also had oxy and much prefer this instead. CodeineEffective pain reliever, haven’t tried since childhoodinfo Still better than oxy OxycontinCauses vertigo to increase, motion sickness, mild pain reliefinfo add textTramadolVery sick - fever, sweatinginfo Forgot when I tried this also, was before I started logging things so at least a few decades. Piracetamyes I mean piracetam and not paracetamol. Debilitating long brain zapsinfo Was kind of winging experimental medications when I first got sick and thought this would help my fatigue and brain fog. It didn't seem to do anything beneficial and started giving me very long brain zaps. I still remember one that lasted 10 minutes straight. I thought I was going to drift into a seizure.  MagnesiumMild side effects, causes headaches, effective laxativeinfo tried a variation of these. Citrate, glycinate, threonate.. all seem to just give me a headache. It's a bit calming and of course laxative effects but overall not worth it. I've never tested my mag levels and not sure if that's even an accurate test but I wonder if I possibly have.. too much? Tanganilno side effects, unsure if useful &lt;summary&gt;info&lt;/summary&gt; This also doesn’t appear to be available in the states so I got this from very legal means as well. No side effects, but not effects of any kind either. It’s supposed to help both hypotensions and central vertigo/balance issues so I was really hoping this would be a match. ProchlorperazineIncreased anxietyinfo I only took this once but it seemed to speed my heart up and caused my adrenaline system to spike. Could this have just been anxiety? Hard to tell.. scared to try it again but maybe I should. coq10heart palpitationsinfo increased palpitations when I took them hoping to reduce them. Not sure what it would do now that I'm not having constant palp issues. Famotidinehelps tachycardia and air hungerinfo Seems to greatly benefit shortness of breath and overall that flushed/adrenaline feeling. Realized later this often is used for mcas symptoms https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8021898/Also apparentlly a lot of people with ALDH2 deficiencies take this to avoid skin flushing with alcohol. ProbioticsDidn’t work at first but then relieved a post viral gi issues I acquired. Certain kinds cause headaches.info Early 2023 I was down with a virus of some sort. When I recovered I had.. some really interesting/embarrassing gi issues that kept me confined near a bathroom at all times. This didn't stop for a month and I ordered visbiome. Within 3 days I regained control of everything. Not only that but after a few weeks my gi issues were better than before I started it. When I try to taper down it returns however.  l theaninegood for jitters, often combined with coffee. Doesn’t seem to help vertigo muchinfo add textNACCaused shortness of breath, may try again with molybdenum since the air hunger could be a result of sulfur buildup.LDNheadaches, fatigueinfo Seemed promising, especially with my recent antibotic response. High safety profile, tons of people improving on it. Its use in areas outside of addiction is still novel and I wasn't sure if I could get a dr to agree to such an odd thing. I found out ageless rx offers it with barely a consult so I went with them. There are other totally legal methods too. I also completely forgot I have friends that are always in rehab and they all have a ton they probably don't take. Somehow got on to my medical record that I take this. I don't like that because many HCW may take this the wrong way and think I've been in addiction treatment.   If you are using the 50mg pills you can dissolve in distilled water in a ratio that's easy to section into the dosages you need then just do a stir of it before taking it daily. I started at .25 then gradually moved to 1mg a day but for months my headaches, myalgia, fatigue just got worse. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6313374/PhenibutThis was supposed to help vertigo and social anxiety, but it made everything so much worse.info I've always noted to take special caution with any medications directly targeting gaba/dopamine. This is such a controversial drug. Unregulated gaba type drug from Russia. High potential for abuse and addiction occurs faster than Benzodiazepines. Similar withdrawals. Technically still legal but its poor reputation has caused most vendors to stop selling it. I think I got mine from liftmode recently which has had QC issues but there's not really a better vendor it seems.  MidodrineFelt tingly but didn’t seem to mess with my BP or heart rate by much. It works for like 30min and I can do chores without getting lightheaded, then for 4hrs I feel worse than before I took it.info Supposed to help with hypotension. LorazepamI don’t “feel” anything. When I confront something that causes vertigo or panic, it seems to stop it? Perhaps I need to do a test and have someone give me a real one and then a sugar pill occasionally and then chart my results. I also realize delusions of sobriety is a thing with this but I doubt I would ever reach that on such low doses. I do have issues standing at a counter 100% of the time and it was so incredible to stand there without any PPPD.I already am fully aware of the consequences the come with daily use. This is just a rescue med for me.More details Took a lot out of me to ask for this and I am now scared to ask for more. All my previous doctors didn't seem to want to prescribe it. My attacks can be back to back and last all day. To a point I can't move or have to crawl. There seems to be very high success with this drug stopping that. It would not only stop the attack but prevent them from being disabled for weeks later since the length of the attack affects recovery. I'd say upwards of 90% of patients were able to escape terrible consequences of vertigo attacks with this. The vestibular patients really encouraged I try to get this. And that yes I risk being labeled as drug seeking unfortunately.     It was really upsetting to me that many were just denied this. That you can lose your job, your house, your family, everything all because no one wanted to trust you with a particular medication.  That being said, I am so grateful my Dr trusts me with this. But I've already lost almost everything at this point already. "

    "content": "I know these are shit diagnoses. I haven’t found an objective answer so I get trash labels slapped on me.Vasovagal SyncopeDiagnosed when I kept fainting. I always thought this condition was fainting over a common fear trigger like sight of blood, needles, etc. When faced with a fear I do not pass out. These events happened spontaniously. Sometimes after a meal, temp changes, infections, digestive issues. These were pretty intense to me as I'd feel overwhelming pain and eventually my legs would go paralyzed, I'd go deaf and blind,... sometimes crawling around while losing consciousness over and over again. I'd go into convulsions while passed out. A few times others said my lips and eyelids turned blue. I suppose that still puts me in the same category as fainting over the sight of blood. Perhaps the mechanism is the same but I hated never knowing why mine were so particularly bad. Why I could handle substantial pain externally but not internall.    DepressionThey gave me this required survey with questionnaires that didn't make much sense to me since a lot of the answers could be misconstrued with being ill. Like not socializing much, having little energy. But I suppose that led to my depression diagnosis.  GADI will admit that ever since I got sick I've been constantly in a state of worry and fear. My mind automatically equates being vulnereable to being open for abuse. Also it's uncomfortable to think about how you're supposed to survive the rest of your life sick.Vestibular Migraines VM Summary     This was an odd one. I started getting vertigo attacks years after my autonomic issues. These things are the most debilitating and horrifying attacks ever to me. On my worst attack, I couldn't move for 20hrs and for another 15hrs I was crawling and bedridden. The room wouldn't stop spinning and I \"blacked out\" psychologically several times from being so overwhelmed. Yeah that also means laying in your own excrements...    After this I had several similar but shorter attacks. Ruled out BPPV. They diagnosed me with menieres but retracted it when my hearing came back fine. I wanted to try the steroid shots so I was bummed that I'd have to prove meniere's before being able to try this. Eventually the diagnosis of Vestibular Migraines was reached. I haven't had a 30+hr attack but will often still have the hour long ones. Whatever anyone wants to call it, they are the worst thing in my life right now. Panic AttacksI was just starting to get my fainting under control when the vertigo started. I lost my mind over this. I started getting panic attacks. I have some times in my life where these are controlled but as of lately they've returned pretty badly. They are back to back also.  POTSThis was diagnosed kind of late for me. I actually mentioned this over a decade ago to a doctor about my syncope issues and was told it's too rare so I dropped it. I feel like it's more under control now but I think maybe my dr just wanted to be able to open the ability for me to try a particular medication that could help my low blood pressure. CFSThis one is pretty common now too I suppose. I have moments where I can barely keep myself upright. I feel sick - like I've been poisoned and it's caused me to collapse from weakness countless times. Quite alarming when it happens, like your body is just shutting down from being poisoned. It does seem to occur when I've exercised too hard or have 'done too much'. Usually occurs the following days after the events. There's a type of fatigue you feel while sick with the virus I can try to equate this to. Some months I'll get a break from it and other months, it's like every damn day.  I have somewhat significant GI issues I also haven’t investigated yet. They’re debilitating and kind of tie in with the whole POTS/CFS/dysautonomia BS I suppose. Yet I feel like I will just be trading thousands of dollars for another dead end answer. I’ll have to wait until I have better insurance, the symptoms are less vague, or I end up underweight from it."

    "content": "I’ve unfortunately grown quite a distrust towards healthcare workers. They also take an offense to this so I can’t speak up about it unless around other patients. If my coworkers were known to hurt others however I wouldn’t blame my clients for feeling the same way. Introspection seems to be an unecessary skill in medicine.I also think it’s both sad and hilarious that they blame the sudden increase of patients from 2020 on tiktok. It reminds me of an out of touch older person with “those damn phones”. Tiktok just unfortunately has a bit of a scary algorithm and maybe being dismissed was already a huge problem that found its way on to the platform. I’m sure a global pandemic at the same time causing long term health issues didn’t help either.Adverse Medication GuidanceIssues with SSRIs I used to disregard mild side effects, thinking they might be from something else or a placebo effect. But there were instances when it was unmistakable, like with Lexapro. After a few days on it, I experienced constant shaking, sickness, and strange sensations. My sleep patterns were erratic; I'd either fall asleep instantly or feel like I'd been awake all day upon waking.I called my doctor's office, and they assured me these initial symptoms were normal, suggesting I take the prescribed hydroxyzine alongside it. I tried to ignore the symptoms. However, on the seventh day, I woke up, got ready for work, and suddenly felt a shock up my spine. I lost sensation in my limbs, collapsed, and experienced total paralysis with no breathing or heartbeat. It was a terrifying experience, and I couldn't even scream. After a minute, I regained feeling and hyperventilated.I called my doctor's office, who advised me to come in without driving. They found elevated vitals and nystagmus but didn't see anything requiring an ER visit. Strangely, my doctor insisted I continue the medication and claimed it was just a placebo in the first month. His reaction left a lasting fear of medication, as I worry there won't be help if something goes wrong. I should have changed doctors, but I hesitated due to the time invested with him and self-doubt about my actions during this incident.Also he had agreed to do further testing as I felt something was very wrong.  Malingering Accusations  Being accused of faking I keep my medical records for accurate reference due to my cognitive and memory issues, relying on OCR technology for recall. When I requested records from my physical therapist (PT), I noticed they mentioned my absence between my initial evaluation and the start of therapy, suggesting I might be malingering. They also questioned the validity of my condition, noting that I briefly stood still while they applied straps and then continued to wobble.  I could have explained the reasons behind these actions (e.g., delays due to financial issues, surgery, the pandemic, and transportation challenges). Additionally, my blood pressure issue affects my vestibular system, so calf tightening briefly stabilizes me but worsens it when released. But they assumed and documented without asking. I worry that future physicians might side with the PT, dismissing the vailidity of my symptoms due to this written statement. Also should I ever need disability assistance in the future, this likely shattered any possibility even though I had proof against it.   I didn't know how to resolve this at the time. Consulting with a psychologist and others, I received mixed advice. Some suggested filing a complaint and correcting it, while others believed the correction might draw more attention and considered it just an opinion. Given the small city and potential system backlash, I hesitated.   This casual approach by my PT, especially after I confided in them about the importance of keeping myself employed as I could end up homeless, has left me feeling betrayed. There appeared to be no turmoil between us and she was quite pleasant. The whole situation really messed with my head. ER Visit Only once I've gone to the ER and don't think I will again unless the cause extremely obvious I went to the ER a long time ago because I kept fainting over and over. I was barely conscious and they kept accusing me of drug use while I was too confused and out of it to understand why they were so insistent on me just telling them what I took. When I finally said I smoked weed as a teenager not knowing what they even wanted from me, th Dr lectured me for using it back then and blamed it on that? Wrote on my chart that I am involved in illicit drug use. Then blamed it on the one cup of coffee I had that morning. I tried to show them everytime I stood up, everything would crash but they kept forcing me to lay back down and wouldn't catch it on any monitors. I was drug tested which was clean and they didn't say anything much after that... wheeled into the billing department to discuss my $5k bill as my head kept falling over due to how ill I was, then told to leave. I sat outside continuing to pass out on the sidewalk. Made me feel both worse and better when I found out this was a common thing for patients and even happened to a few others I know of. I won't visit an ER anymore now if I think I'm dying. Urgent care or I'll take my chances if I can't move.    Proofscreenshots from online forumsI thought it was something I was doing wrong for a while until I realized this is just what happens when you have these symptoms and no answers.   Got me a bit curious about why, with all their education, they can assume malice/laziness so confidently. A lot of the patients they mock used to be highly driven, but apparently no one with invisible illnesses suffer the way the healthcare workers do so no one has the right to complain.    Perhaps it can feel safer to conclude that patients are exaggerating or somehow responsible for their lack of improvement instead of the uncomfortable fact that the system is broken and coerces patients into unecessary medical visits.     I don't see a way to win this battle. It feels like even a good portion are actively working against their patients. For what reason? Another reason I'm not really getting much worked up anymore. "

This is a controversial treatment for autonomic issues but I wanted to at least try it and see how much of a difference it would make.At first I couldn’t even get an appointment in until a week after trying and then it was canceled and postponed another two days by them so trying to get it set up for the height of symptoms or prevention seemed to not be in my favor.I also had requested the package that contains pms and illness alleviation as I was recovering from a viral infection and still feeling like shit. I think it had extra magnesium and anti-inflammatories. Unfortunately they just gave me a standard myers cocktail. Perhaps if this all had been done correctly I may have experienced relief. I was a bit nervous about large amounts of NSAIDs however and its effects on my GI system so I suppose it could have gone south anyways.Unfortunately nothing much was felt besides increased hydration. I even woke up with a headache the next day.I hope to possibly use them in the event of an intense painful migraine attack as they have toradol and zofran, but if it takes them over a week to get to me I see no point. Maybe I could have someone drive me there."

    "content": "Initial testingIn 2018, I had originally had my first vestibular tests and VRT recommendations. At the time I had put this off due to financial issues. I realized I could just do these at home so what sense would it make to pay thousands of dollars when I could use that money for a second opinion or further investigation?Vestibular TherapyMany years went by and I had some extra health surprises along the way that postponed this including the pandemic, but I eventually returned to them in 2021 when my vestibular system got worse again after the covid vaccine. It was early release so I was not under any regulatory pressure to have taken it, and didn’t assume it would do more than put me out for a few days. Unfortunately it threw me into a flare so intense that I was considering a wheelchair or rollator.There was a lot of controversy surrounding this at the time so I remained quiet and just told healthcare workers it must have been from covid because I was so weak and sick that I didn’t have the strength for others to make this a political issue.Despite this, the first thing the vestibular therapist asked me was if I recentlly had the vaccine and I admitted I had. She did mention that this seemed to be a common theme with them. https://vestibular.org/forum/dizziness/covid-19-vaccine-side-effects/Regardless, we dropped the subject and continued with treatment.I was scheduled to be there 2 days a week. I was unable to drive the distance to this area. It was in an adjoined city. So taking an uber/lyft would get me there but I’d have no way of getting home because the starting destination had no drivers. And perhaps I’m just not understanding things socially but I didn’t have anyone available to be there for me 2x a week and assumed this was a normal problem for others but the workers seemed to be frustrated with me on this topic. Nonetheless I discovered that I could use paratransit if my PT cooperated with the paperwork which she did. Why didn’t she suggest this in the first place? Again… maybe I truly am so isolated that I saw the prospect of having someone there for me at all times as incredulous.The exercises always temporarily corrected my balance disorder but the next large vertigo attack would set me back. As I’ve always known this to be an issue and explained it to them. They had to see it for themselves and also came to the conclusion in the end that until my vertigo attacks stop, the balance correction will always be set back.My insurance barely covered this so I ended up paying quite a bit for the sessions in the end. Theoretically I did this because I knew I had to prove that I tried it should I ever need less commonly covered treatments in the future such as botox or CGRPs, etc..medical notes:DiagnosisR42Dizziness and giddinessR26.81Unsteadiness on feetVNGSpontaneous Nystagmus without Fixationno abnormalities notedSpontaneous Nystagmus with Fixationno abnormalities notedHead Shake Nystagmusno abnormalities notedGaze Centerno abnormalities notedGaze Leftno abnormalities notedGaze Rightno abnormalities noted Gaze Upno abnormalities notedGaze Downno abnormalities noted Random Saccadesno abnormalities noted Smooth Pursuit Horizontal no abnormalities noted Optokinetic Left 20 dpsno abnormalities noted Optokinetic Right 20 dpsno abnormalities noted Dix-Hallpike LeftNo nystagmus notedDix-Hallpike RightNo nystagmus notedPositional Nystagmus SupineMinor left beating nystagmus notedPositional Head RightNo nystagmus notedPositional Head LeftNon fatiguing left beating nystagmus noted.

    "content": "It’s hard to identify the causes. At one point I had no issues driving to work, working long hours, being active, socializing, functioning on low sleep and caffeine. I had little to no anxiety and could take risks/be on stage. Then suddenly I started feeling more “off” after a particularly bad infection. Until the day I pushed myself too hard and my body just … shut down. Ever since then I’ve been unwell with a myriad of physiologic and psychologic symptoms.Viral/BacterialMaybe at some point in 2009 I got sick. I usually catch something every year so this wasn’t alarming for me in any way. I remember this being particularly bad however. I was pissing and coughing up blood. I had no insurance at the time which wasn’t uncommon for my specific situation (young 20s, no parents, recession). At some point I went to an urgent care and quick clinic. I do remember being prescribed Cipro, and getting upset I wasn’t warned about how intense the symptoms would be. I didn’t take my last few doses either. One way or another I recovered but never bounced back to my usual self and had residual symptoms that I brushed off. I tried to obtain my medical records from this time but they said they didn’t exist. I later found out that may have been a lie since my dr many many years later confirmed I had been there at that time.I think it was a kidney infection and strep together somehow. I don’t think I remember or was told what the actual infection was. Again, I thought I’d just eventually get over it.Also strange thing that has happened was a temporary resolution of all symptoms while on azithromycin.EnvironmentalI was living in pretty trashy conditions. I didn’t care about diseases. I mean,… all of my friends were living this way, some even worse, and they were all fine. There was mold in my apartment. Mouse infestations. Terrible diet choices. I lived on little sleep and cheap food. This was also a problem for me for a while as a kid also since my parents struggled with money for a while until I was a bit older. I had been homeless several times then and briefly past 18. Slept outside multiple times, occasionally in the middle of winter and remember getting quite sick over it.Still .. I had started to improve my living conditions and career one step at a time. Especailly after that viral infection that took me down, I realized I needed to step up a bit with my overall health choices.Also wonder if the climate of this area has anything to do with it. I’ve never tried living elsewhere.GeneticsThis is all still such a new field. I did end up pulling my raw data from a consumer dna kit into an aggregator that links health similarities of the carriers to certain SNPs. Still just theoretical but many held heavy weight with tons of accredited studies.The top confident findings indicated poor drug metabolism. A lot of cardiac issues. Nothing that stuck out as completely suggestive of a predisposed weakness that could have caused this all to happen.My family health history was also a mess but nothing too solid genetically. The usual just overall shit genes situation. Cancers, heart disease, diabetes, depression, anxiety, stupidity, etc.I seem to be predisposed to hypertension in particular which is curious to me, as I struggle with hypotension.PyschologicalThis is an uncomfortable topic of causataion for me and many others. And since it’s a spectrum that cannot be objectively measured, it leaves a lot to be debated.There’s no doubt I may have psychiatric conditions weighing as a possible trigger. Both genetic and past socioeconomic struggles and ACE factors definitely put me at risk.My first therapist mentioned the possibility of my sympathetic nervous sytem being compromised and allowing illnesses that most would brush off to be overwhelming for me. I also am convinced this lowers immunity and leaves you more susceptible to actual physical damage to diseases. Damage that we just can’t objectively measure yet.I also did eventually see a psychologist. He was nice and empathetic but I don’t think much was discovered out of the limited sessions I could afford. It also seemed like he didn’t quite understand why I was there in the first place.  Overall I was just trying to see if a professional could tease out if I truly am having all of these issues due to a psychological standpoint but he seemed to be convinced mine were physical while my therapist before him was convinced it was psychological."
