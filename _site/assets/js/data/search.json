Had I known she would have noted it this way I would have just told her to start over again       EEG(it was like an hr, a month after a major but brief paralysis attack). Nothing remarkable MRIonly white matter hyperintensities apparently not a cause of concern and etiology still a medical debateIndication:SYNCOPE AND COLLAPSE Technique: Sagittal T1, axial T1, axial T2, axial FLAIR, coronal FLAIR, axial and coronal T1 postcontrast, diffusion and ADC map were obtained. The examination was performed before and after injection of 5.5 mL of Gadavist. Findings: Few tiny foci of T2 hyperintensity in bilateral frontal deep white matter represent nonspecific gliosis and of doubtful clinical significance. Dilated perivascular space in the right lentiform nucleus is a normal variant. No intracranial space-occupying lesions or abnormal enhancement. The craniocervical junction is unremarkable. No intracranial hemorrhage. No hydrocephalus. No midline shift. No evidence of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarction. The visualized intracranial flow-voids appear grossly unremarkable. Minimal mucosal thickening is seen in the anterior ethmoid air cells, the remaining visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells bilaterally are essentially well-aerated. Impression: Essentially unremarkable brain MRI without and with contrast.Loop recorderdidn’t catch anything. I’d get a bill for every manual record I pressed so it was difficult to capture these as I would second guess myself and it would be too late if I finally fainted. But I did faint a few times and nothing got automatically triggered. Very confused about this They also told me there’s no way it’s dead already as they would have been notified first and I had to go there and they confirmed it was dead.   I can’t afford to remove it…Various Blood testsSeveral blood tests over the years and the only odd thing has been isolated b6 deficiency (meaning other b vitamins were normal) which is rare. Could be due to malabsorption of some sort? Also I tried quite a few times to get hormonal panels done with the gyn and was denied so I gave up. It costed money and pto just to ask.Home monitoring devices-Glucose has been caught multiple times in hypoglycemia levels (with symptoms) hours after carbs. Conclusive of reactive hypoglycemia.-Blood pressure has been taken moments before loss of consciousness showing remarkably low. Heart rate rises them plummets sharply vice versa-o2 has been consistently well even during times of shortness of breath. This only goes low during respriratory illnesses, understandably. -Temp appears challenging to accurately capture. Under the tongue and against temple is almost always 96 but that seems too low. Clinically I run around 98. -6L ECG rarely shows anything outside of benign pvcs Tests to be done:VEMPColonoscopyCT specifically for SCDS(this may be impossible to get in my city and I can’t drive)"

    "content": "I seem to already be predispositioned to issues with medications.Especially to medications that use Cyp2c19 (A,A)https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs4244285High amount of studies + rare in N. America (common in Asia 30%?)Nonetheless I’ve been told to not put much weight in these studies from quite a few medical professionals so I suppose it’s all just my hypothetical ramblings.disclaimer: this is just one of many variants that could effect metabolism of medications that use cyp2c19.Medications I’ve triedYMMV . My current set of issues can influence how medications affect me much differently than someone with a different set of symptoms. Poor drug metabolism is also a factor here. I am also aware that some of these effects can be attributed to the ‘nocebo’ or ‘placebo’ effect, and they can even be influenced by what you ate that day. However, the side effects I experienced or assumed were so strong at times that I am wary about trying it again. Also I’ve never had the ability to take more than a few days away from work so I often had to stop treatment if I couldn’t be bedridden for very long.  Benadryloccasionally very sick next day , flu like symptomsinfoMy Dr at the time had told me it's ok to use this nightly as a sleep aid but I eventually realized it was dramatically increasing my symptoms so I stoppped. MeclizineHave sublingual tabs that reduce about 20%, definitely not great for severe attacks, the pills don’t seem to be as effective eitherinfo These can work pretty fast and more efficiently than the pills     HydroxyzineThese do seem to make me drowsy, and reduce some anxiety, but it causes an increase in attacks if I take it too often.info It's technically an antihistamine but has anti anxiety properties for some patients. I actually took it briefly many years ago and it made me feel really weird. This time around I tried it again and it seemed to work better. 10mg is often all that's needed to get drowsy but during an attack I may take upwards of 50 to 75mg. I think 100 is the max but can still extend beyond that. For a while I was taking it all day during a bad attack (like 10mg every hour until I was calm again) and I think it was causing substantially increased rebound anxiety as it wore off. It does seem to dramatically reduce my blood pressure and heart rate. I already have issues with hypotension so lowering it more also may have been causing increased anxiety. I would usually sleep on it, but the after effects still had that vital lowering effect for a whole day after.  DimenhydrinateMild sedative even in larger doses for me, increases symptomsinfo These are often sold as dramamine. I always got carsick so that mixed with my autonomic issues at the time made long trips terrible. I decided to keep it on me during a recent trip just in case. 5hr car ride, -10f, little sleep and we made it to the hotel. I took an elevator up 8 floors to my room. The elevator sensation never stopped for me. Constant falling sensation. I took a dramamine, tried to ignore it, and went back down the elevator to have dinner. Middle of dinner I felt like I was going to faint. Tried to escape but didn't make it and fainted in front of the entire restaurant. Caused a scene since I went into convulsions. EMT called. Spent rest of my vacation in my room vomiting. Thank you dramamine.    Theoretically now I assume my blood pressure was low and it dropped it even lower making me highly susceptible to fainting. I was still quite new to my issues at the time.  Doxylamine succinateEffective sleeping medicine, fast tolerance, mild hangover effectinfo I notice these are one of the few otc sleeping pills I can somewhat handle. I noticed this when I realized I could handle nyquil fine and this is a main ingredient. It seems like unisom is the main manufacturer of this. I prefer to have a liquid version since I don't like taking even a small amount more than I should, just enough to drift to sleep. I don't know what the long term consequences are of these in particular. Cholinergics theoretically linked to dementia. But I also know without sleep, I lose my job and my mind.    BetahistineIncreased GI issues, mild relief of vertigoinfo This was suggested to me by others with similar issues. It appears to be commonly prescribed in other countries for vertigo but not approved in the states. I took other totally very legal means of acquiring this to try it.   I started with half a dose but it didn't seem to do anything so gradually increased to full dose. It did seem to almost dull the sensation of vertigo a bit. Like it was holding the middle ear down with static. But just barely and the GI symptoms I had from it didn't go away with time. It also can counteract some antihistamines which I rely on occasionally so it was not worth it to me.  OndansetronCauses a headache, but effective anti nausea med.info  AcetaminophenNo obvious side effects, but also very low efficacyinfo Since this is low efficacy and it's rare for me to have a fever, I usually don't take this very often. Alternative if you have issues with NSAIDs so I'm trying to not ruin my gut on NSAIDs to begin with so I don't have only this to rely on. IbuprofenGI issues if too often, but effective pain reliefinfo This is actually pretty decent for pain in most cases, although I've had it not come through for me in rare moments. Caution does need to be exercised with this, however, as it reduces the mucus you generate in your stomach, hence the advice to eat with it. I do my best to stay at 200mg, only taking it if my pain is so bad that I can't work, sleep, or am fainting... and not more than a few days in a row. Rebound occurs anyway      NaproxenTried for cramps, headaches, muscle aches. Doesn’t work?info I honestly haven't figured out what this even helps with so far. It's another NSAID too so definitely not worth it for me. CBDOccasionally works for pain and anxiety, but often not at all.info THC increases my vertigo (sad days) but it seems like a little bit is needed for CBD to be more pronounced. Still seems too low at the federal limit anyways. I've tried various reputable oils and balms. Very hit or miss. I wonder if I just don't metabolize it most of the time. Sometimes it works great. Since there's practically no issues with safety I always give it a shot to see if it will work for something mild. PropranololMade my BP crash; caused more anxietyinfo I already have issues with low BP so this wasn't a good mix. I went in prepared for that though so maybe I was setting myself up to fail. I even tried it for performance anxiety. It's supposed to stop all your physical symptoms. It kind of did... but not mentally, then I fainted. TopamaxDaily panic attacks first week, was told to stop itinfo I really wanted this to work. At the time I was desparate and just wanted something to work. I was in a state of constant high anxiety and panic. I would just sit on the floor shaking, sweating, delerious. and my boyfriend at the time told me I probably should stop them but I was determined to \"get used to it\". I called my new Dr at the time and he told me to stop them. Since I felt so awful it was hard to argue with that but I wonder why he would tell me to stop over something like that when my last doctor got mad that I wanted to stop over sudden paralysis? Wild ProgesteroneCream and pill ; dramatically increased vertigo, couldn’t stick with itinfo Really wanted this to work. Severe attacks almost always have occured during hormonal shifts within my cycle. I couldn't handle it anymore. Even the smallest spike sent me into a cluster of attacks. Maybe I'll try this when I'm a bit older as hormonal balances change often.  DepoBled for 8 months straight, increase in all symptoms, almost lost jobinfo I remember long ago getting on this hoping it would stop my period but instead it made me sick for months and my period never stopped. I called the office about this and they told me 'just give it more time'. I didn't continue the series as I would have been homeless without an income. If it got any worse I would have had to stop working.    AzithromycinTemporarily stopped all symptoms for 2 weeks, gradual return to baselineinfo I was actually pretty nervous to take this but within 3hrs all of my symptoms disappeared. It stayed like this until 2 weeks after the last dose. One of the first 'this can't be a placebo' moments I've ever had because it was like a heavy fog had lifted from me and I had never felt that clear headed since before I got sick.  I've told multiple doctors about this and most just give it the eyebrow raise and continue with stanadard treatment layout.  I was given another round by my pcp however but it wasn't as effective I assume since it was less than a year from my last dose. Also would like to avoid constant abx use for obvious reasons.  CiproIntense joint pains and increased feverinfo This was a long time ago so it's hard to accurately document what happened. Back when I used to just take what's given to me without hesitation or question. I remember not being able to finish it and it costing me more days from work as it made me even more sick and immobile with joint pain. I probably should have finished it, I remember I had like 2 left and really needed to get back to work.   MetronidazoleKept throwing up the pills, high amounts of abdominal paininfo Little embarrassed about why I had to take this but what it was resolving just wasn't worth the pain. Made all my symptoms worse. EscitalopramSudden complete paralysis and intense fear, stomach problems, fever, sweating, diarhhea, tremblinginfo This was  the worst reaction I've ever had to any substance ever. I'm not convinced this was nocebo at all in the slightest. This was a gradual worsening until the attack. I'm not sure why. Either it's because I can't excrete it and it builds up then releases in my blood stream all at once.. or it caused my already low electrolytes to bottom out. Dr at the time was upset I didn't want to continue.   AmitryptilineCan’t handle doses over 25mg but will hit tolerance and just have to stop, helps sleep and appetite,info I was actually on this for a long time. The side effects were mild and some actually beneficial. It did nothing for my vertigo and slightly even increased positional tachycardia but I was sleeping 12hrs a day, barely awake when I was up, and eating more. Before I started it, I was sleep deprived and having issues keeping food down. I also liked not being conscious.. a lot. I remember I was not doing a good job at work and didn't even care. I hit tolerance but started getting headaches if I increased my dose past 25mg. So I had to stop them. Might return someday since tolerance is reset. It's a good medication to kind of stop me from losing my mind. AlbuterolNo issues. I don’t use this unless I feel like I’m dyinginfo After a respiratory illness I was having issues waking up feeling like my diaphragm was paralyzed and not being able to take a breath for a minute before finally catching my breath. I was told to try PPIs even though I felt no heartburn. I requested an inhaler should it happen again and it did help a bit. I only use it during respriratory infections now. OmeprazoleBack pain, increased abdominal issuesinfo I tried these for a bit but they didn't help my shortness of breath attacks much plus added new problems.  HydrocodoneEffective pain reliever, only used onceinfo I forgot when I last tried this but remember it working really well. I've also had oxy and much prefer this instead. CodeineEffective pain reliever, haven’t tried since childhoodinfo Still better than oxy OxycontinCauses vertigo to increase, motion sickness, mild pain reliefinfo add textTramadolVery sick - fever, sweatinginfo Forgot when I tried this also, was before I started logging things so at least a few decades. Piracetamyes I mean piracetam and not paracetamol Debilitating long brain zapsinfo Was kind of winging experimental medications when I first got sick and thought this would help my fatigue and brain fog. It didn't seem to do anything beneficial and started giving me very long brain zaps. I still remember one that lasted 10 minutes straight. I thought I was going to drift into a seizure.  MagnesiumMild side effects, causes headaches, effective laxativeinfo tried a variation of these. Citrate, glycinate, threonate.. all seem to just give me a headache. It's a bit calming and of course laxative effects but overall not worth it. I've never tested my mag levels and not sure if that's even an accurate test but I wonder if I possibly have.. too much? Tanganilno side effects, unsure if useful &lt;summary&gt;info&lt;/summary&gt; This also doesn’t appear to be available in the states so I got this from very legal means as well. No side effects, but not effects of any kind either. It’s supposed to help both hypotensions and central vertigo/balance issues so I was really hoping this would be a match.&lt;/details&gt; ProchlorperazineIncreased anxietyinfo I only took this once but it seemed to speed my heart up and caused my adrenaline system to spike. Could this have just been anxiety? Hard to tell.. scared to try it again but maybe I should. coq10heart palpitationsinfo increased palpitations when I took them hoping to reduce them. Not sure what it would do now that I'm not having constant palp issues. Famotidinehelps tachycardia and air hungerinfo Seems to greatly benefit shortness of breath and overall that flushed/adrenaline feeling. Realized later this often is used for mcas symptoms https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8021898/ProbioticsDidn’t work at first but then relieved a post viral gi issues I acquired. Certain kinds cause headaches.info add textl theaninegood for jitters, often combined with coffee. Doesn’t seem to help vertigo muchinfo add textLDNheadaches, fatigueinfo Seemed promising, especially with my recent antibotic response. High safety profile, tons of people improving on it. Its use in areas outside of addiction is still novel and I wasn't sure if I could get a dr to agree to such an odd thing. I found out ageless rx offers it with barely a consult so I went with them. There are other totally legal methods too. I also completely forgot I have friends that are always in rehab and they all have a ton they probably don't take. Somehow got on to my medical record that I take this. I don't like that because many HCW may take this the wrong way and think I've been in addiction treatment.   If you are using the 50mg pills you can dissolve in distilled water in a ratio that's easy to section into the dosages you need then just do a stir of it before taking it daily. I started at .25 then gradually moved to 1mg a day but for months my headaches, myalgia, fatigue just got worse. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6313374/PhenibutThis was supposed to help vertigo and social anxiety, but it made everything so much worse.info I've always noted to take special caution with any medications directly targeting gaba/dopamine. This is such a controversial drug. Unregulated gaba type drug from Russia. High potential for abuse and addiction occurs faster than Benzodiazepines. Similar withdrawals. Technically still legal but it's poor reputation has caused most vendors to stop selling it. I think I got mine from liftmode recently which has had QC issues but there's not really a better vendor it seems.  MidodrineFelt tingly but didn’t seem to mess with my BP or heart rate by much. It works for like 30min and I can do chores without getting lightheaded, then for 4hrs I feel worse than before I took it.info Supposed to help with hypotension. LorazepamI don’t “feel” anything. When I confront something that causes vertigo or panic, it seems to stop it? Perhaps I need to do a test and have someone give me a real one and then a sugar pill occasionally and then chart my results. I also realize delusions of sobriety is a thing with this but I doubt I would ever reach that on such low doses. I do have issues standing at a counter 100% of the time and it was so incredible to stand there without any PPPD.More details Took a lot out of me to ask for this and I am now scared to ask for more. All my previous doctors didn't seem to want to prescribe it. My attacks can be back to back and last all day. To a point I can't move or have to crawl. There seems to be very high success with this drug stopping that. It would not only stop the attack but prevent them from being disabled for weeks later since the length of the attack affects recovery. I'd say upwards of 90% of patients were able to escape terrible consequences of vertigo attacks with this. The vestibular patients really encouraged I try to get this. And that yes I risk being labeled as drug seeking unfortunately.    It was really upsetting to me that many were just denied this. That you can lose your job, your house, your family, everything all because no one wanted to trust you with a particular medication.   That being said, I am so grateful my Dr trusts me with this. "

    "content": "I know these are shit diagnoses. I haven’t found an objective answer so I get trash labels slapped on me.Vasovagal SyncopeDiagnosed when I kept fainting. I always thought this condition was fainging over a common fear trigger like sight of blood, needles, etc. When faced with a fear I do not pass out. These events happened spontaniously. Sometimes after a meal, temp changes, infections, digestive issues. These were pretty intense to me as I’d feel overwhelming pain and eventually my legs would go paralyzed, I’d go deaf and blind,… sometimes crawling around while losing consciousness over and over again. I’d go into convulsions while passed out. A few times others said my lips and eyelids turned blue. I suppose that still puts me in the same category as fainting over the sight of blood. Perhaps the mechanism is the same but I hated never knowing why mine were so particularly bad.DepressionThey gave me this required survey thing with questionnaires that didn’t make much sense to me since a lot of the answers could be misconstrued with being ill. Like not socializing much, having little energy. But I suppose that led to my depression diagnosis. HaGADI will admit that ever since I got sick I’ve been constantly in a state of worry and fear. My mind automatically equates being vulnereable to being open for abuse.Vestibular MigrainesThis was an odd one. I started getting vertigo attacks years after my autonomic issues. These things are the most debilitating and horrifying things ever to me. On my worst attack, I couldn’t move for 20hrs and for another 15hrs I was crawling and bedridden. The room wouldn’t stop spinning and I “blacked out” psychologically several times from being so overwhelmed. I had dried vomit and piss on myself since I couldn’t move. After this I had several similar but shorter attacks. Ruled out BPPV. They diagnosed me with menieres but retracted it when my hearing came back fine. I wanted to try the steroid shots so I was bummed that I’d have to prove meniere’s before being able to try this. Eventually the diagnosis of Vestibular Migraines was reached. I haven’t had a 30+hr attack but will often still have the hour long ones. Whatever anyone wants to call it, they are the worst thing in my life right now.Panic AttacksI was just starting to get my fainting under control when the vertigo started. I lost my mind over this. I started getting panic attacks. I have some times in my life where these are controlled but as of lately they’ve returned pretty badly. They are back to back also.POTSThis was diagnosed kind of late for me. I actually mentioned this over a decade ago to a doctor about my syncope issues and was told it’s too rare so I dropped it. I feel like it’s more under control now but I think maybe my dr just wanted to be able to open the ability for me to try a particular medication that could help my low blood pressure.CFSThis one is pretty common now too I suppose. I have moments where I can barely keep myself upright. I feel sick - like I’ve been poisoned and it’s caused me to collapse from weakness countless times. Quite alarming when it happens, like your body is just shutting down from being poisoned. It does seem to occur when I’ve exercised too hard or have ‘done too much’. Usually occurs the following days after the events. There’s a type of fatigue you feel while sick with the virus I can try to equate this to. Some months I’ll get a break from it and other months, it’s like every damn day.I have somewhat significant GI issues I also haven’t investigated yet. They’re debilitating and kind of tie in with the whole POTS/CFS/dysautonomia BS I suppose. Yet I feel like I will just be trading thousands of dollars for another dead end answer."

    "content": "Initial testingIn 2018, I had originally had my first vestibular tests and VRT recommendations. At the time I had put this off due to financial issues. I realized I could just do these at home so what sense would it make to pay thousands of dollars when I could use that money for a second opinion or further investigation?Vestibular TherapyMany years went by and I had some extra health surprises along the way that postponed this including the pandemic, but I eventually returned to them in 2021 when my vestibular system got worse again after the covid vaccine. It was early release so I was not under any regulatory pressure to have taken it, and didn’t assume it would do more than put me out for a few days. Unfortunately it threw me into a flare so intense that I was considering a wheelchair or rollator.There was a lot of controversy surrounding this at the time so I remained quiet and just told healthcare workers it must have been from covid because I was so weak and sick that I didn’t have the strength for others to make this a political issue.Despite this, the first thing the vestibular therapist asked me was if I recentlly had the vaccine and I admitted I had. She did mention that this seemed to be a common theme with them. https://vestibular.org/forum/dizziness/covid-19-vaccine-side-effects/Regardless, we dropped the subject and continued with treatment.I was scheduled to be there 2 days a week. I was unable to drive the distance to this area. It was in an adjoined city. So taking an uber/lyft would get me there but I’d have no way of getting home. And perhaps I’m just not understanding things socially but I didn’t have anyone available to be there for me 2x a week and assumed this was a normal problem for others but the workers seemed to be frustrated with me on this topic. Nonetheless I discovered that I could use paratransit if my PT cooperated with the paperwork which she did. Why didn’t she suggest this in the first place? Again… maybe I truly am so isolated that I saw the prospect of having someone there for me at all times as incredulous.The exercises always temporarily corrected my balance disorder but the next large vertigo attack would set me back. As I’ve always known this to be an issue and explained it to them. They had to see it for themselves and also came to the conclusion in the end that until my vertigo attacks stop, the balance correction will always be set back.My insurance barely covered this so I ended up paying quite a bit for the sessions in the end. Theoretically I did this because I knew I had to prove that I tried it should I ever need less commonly covered treatments in the future such as botox or CGRPs, etc.."

    "content": "It’s hard to identify the causes. At one point I had no issues driving to work, working long hours, being active, socializing, functioning on low sleep, caffeine, then suddenly I started feeling more “off” after a particularly bad infection. Until the day I pushed myself too hard and my body just … shut down. Did I always have this weakness in me and all of the below were just catalysts? Since I wasn’t exactly focusing on my health, these events are foggy.Viral/BacterialMaybe at some point in 2009 I got sick. I usually catch something every year so this wasn’t alarming for me in any way. I remember this being particularly bad however. I was pissing and coughing up blood. I had no insurance at the time which wasn’t uncommon for my specific situation (young 20s, no parents, recession). At some point I went to an urgent care and quick clinic. I do remember being prescribed Cipro, and getting upset I wasn’t warned about how intense the symptoms would be. I didn’t take my last few doses either. One way or another I recovered but never bounced back to my usual self and had residual symptoms that I brushed off. I tried to obtain my medical records from this time but they said they didn’t exist. I later found out that may have been a lie since my dr many many years later confirmed I had been there at that time.I think it was a kidney infection and strep together somehow. I don’t think I remember or was told what the actual infection was. Also strange thing that has happened was a temporary resolution of all symptoms while on azithromycin.EnvironmentalI was living in pretty trashy conditions. I didn’t care about diseases. I mean,… all of my friends were living this way, some even worse, and they were all fine. There was mold in my apartment. Mouse infestations. Terrible diet choices. I lived on little sleep. This was also a problem for me from birth until about 8yrs old also since my parents struggled with money for a while. I had been homeless several times then and briefly past 18. Slept outside multiple times, occasionally in the middle of winter and remember getting quite sick over it.Still .. I had started to improve my living conditions and career one step at a time. Especailly after that viral infection that took me down, I realized I needed to step up a bit with my overall health choices.Also wonder if the climate of this area has anything to do with it. I’ve never tried living elsewhere.GeneticsThis is all still such a new field. I did end up pulling my raw data from a consumer dna kit into an aggregator that links health similarities of the carriers to certain SNPs. Some of course still just theoretical but many held heavy weight with tons of accredited studies.The top confident findings indicated poor drug metabolism. A lot of cardiac issues. Nothing that stuck out as completely suggestive of a predisposed weakness that could have caused this all to happen.My family health history was also a mess but nothing too solid genetically. The usual just overall shit genes situation. Cancers, heart disease, diabetes, depression, anxiety, stupidity, etc.I seem to be predisposed to hypertension in particular which is curious to me, as I struggle with hypotension.PyschologicalThis is an uncomfortable topic of causataion for me and many others. And since it’s a spectrum that cannot be objectively measured, it leaves a lot to be debated.That being said, my family is rife with anxiety, depression, panic attacks, addictions, abuse, etc. And I can certainly attest that I’ve felt some of these strongly. Especially the panic attacks which in itself can feel worse than most physical problems I’ve ever had. There was also a lot of abuse present that I’ve discovered scores a 9 for me on ACE. I realized this long ago before I even became sick. And I didn’t want to be a statistic. I had psychology text books as a child in hopes that educating myself to what was happening to me would prevent me from being victimized to these things. After I moved out I never had flashbacks. But the hypervigilance was always there.I caught myself making some poor decisions and slowly tried to right my wrongs over time. Hoping that in time, my brain would catch up and be… as close to normal as I could hope for.But maybe there is just something about the way this all shaped me that ultimately led to my downfall. My first therapist mentioned the possibility of my sympathetic nervous sytem being compromised and allowing illnesses that most would brush off to be overwhelming for me. I also am convinced this lowers immunity and leaves you more susceptible to actual physical damage to diseases. Damage that we just can’t objectively measure yet.I also did eventually see a psychologist. He was nice and empathetic but I don’t think much was discovered out of the limited sessions I could afford. Overall I was just trying to see if a professional could tease out if I truly am having all of these issues due to a psychological standpoint but he seemed to be convinced mine were physical while my therapist before him was convinced it was psychological."

    "content": "I often encounter people who don’t understand why I make the choices I do. They wonder why I don’t just quit and try to get on SSDI. They question why I stopped trying to find answers or why I won’t go to the emergency room when a severe event occurs. They think it’s absolutely foolish, etc., etc. Honestly, I’m not sure if they realize how complicated my situation is.   Financial - I don’t make much at work. And I can’t really make more since I’m already pushing myself until I collapse. Imagine starting another job when you’re already prone to missing 3 or more days a month minimum. You usually have to have good standing for a while before benefits are attainable like fmla. Highly prone to getting fired in the first year when you mess up like that.  Insurance - I have high premiums high deductible and the price increases every year with age. There’s also very little coverage on visits, surgeries, tests, procedures. I tried to see if there were better options on the marketplace but it shows it will only match my employer.  Support - I haven’t had very solid proof. Clinically they’ve caught some things like nystagmus, low blood pressure, but that’s not really enough to convince anyone. Therefore I have little support from Drs. They typically look down on my diagnoses anyways. I also lost most of my connections. It’s a common thing to become isolated when sick. Especially if all you can manage is work and rest.  Transportation Due to the nature of my issue, travel of any sort is incredibly difficult. I can’t drive anymore and just being a passenger can leave me sick for days. I also have to ask someone to take me to other cities and that means we both need to request PTO for that day since specialists aren’t exactly “come in when it’s convenient for you”. They also can cancel on you at any time. This city is somewhat limited on medical resources. No independent labs so I can’t just telehealth and get what’s recommended. Very few or no specialized doctors or clinics for certain things like autonomic issues.  Stubbornness This one I should probably work on but it’s really difficult to beg for help and be a burden on others. Asking for help leaves you open for others to criticize you. Call you lazy, a beggar, leech, etc. It’s also hard for me to maintain friendships. Imagine always causing a scene, especially if it’s someone’s big day. Many get so frustrated with you over it and think you can somehow control it, some think you are attention seeking. I’d rather just die tbh."

    "content": "I have trust issues with healthcare workers due to negative experiences despite my efforts to cooperate. I sought a psychologist for insight, but can’t continue due to cost. People do think I’m apathetic, which might influence healthcare workers negatively, though it’s unreasonable to expect perfect cheerfulness when I’m ill. Their poor judgements have costed me financially and could negatively effect my care, especially since my medical conditions are hard to prove.  Disbelief of side effectsAn event where I was told to keep taking something that harmed me  I used to disregard mild side effects, thinking they might be from something else or a placebo effect. But there were instances when it was unmistakable, like with Lexapro. After a few days on it, I experienced constant shaking, sickness, and strange sensations. My sleep patterns were erratic; I'd either fall asleep instantly or feel like I'd been awake all day upon waking.I called my doctor's office, and they assured me these initial symptoms were normal, suggesting I take the prescribed hydroxyzine alongside it. Trusting my doctor, I tried to ignore the symptoms. However, on the seventh day, I woke up, got ready for work, and suddenly felt a shock up my spine. I lost sensation in my limbs, collapsed, and experienced total paralysis with no breathing or heartbeat. It was a terrifying experience, and I couldn't even scream. After a minute, I regained feeling and hyperventilated.My boyfriend at the time couldn't help due to work, and I called my doctor's office, who advised me to come in without driving. They found elevated vitals and nystagmus but didn't see anything requiring an ER visit. Strangely, my doctor insisted I continue the medication and claimed it was just a placebo in the first month. His reaction left a lasting fear of medication, as I worry there won't be help if something goes wrong. I should have changed doctors, but I hesitated due to the time invested with him and self-doubt about my actions during this incident.Also he had agreed to do further testing as I felt something was very wrong.  Malingering Accusations  Being accused of faking I keep my medical records for accurate reference due to my cognitive and memory issues, relying on OCR technology for recall. When I requested records from my physical therapist (PT), I noticed they mentioned my absence between my initial evaluation and the start of therapy, suggesting I might be malingering. They also questioned the validity of my condition, noting that I briefly stood still while they applied straps and then continued to wobble.I could have explained the reasons behind these actions (e.g., delays due to financial issues, surgery, the pandemic, and transportation challenges). Additionally, my blood pressure issue affects my vestibular system, so calf tightening briefly stabilizes me but worsens it when released. Ironically, But they assumed and documented without asking. I worry that future physicians might side with the PT, dismissing my case due to this written statement.I didn't know how to resolve this at the time. Consulting with a psychologist and others, I received mixed advice. Some suggested filing a complaint and correcting it, while others believed the correction might draw more attention and considered it just an opinion. Given the small city and potential system backlash, I hesitated.   I've been warned that this incident could harm future attempts at Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) if I become unable to work due to my condition. This casual approach by my PT, especially after I confided in them about the importance of keeping myself employed as I could end up homeless, has left me feeling betrayed. There appeared to be no turmoil between us and she was quite pleasant. The whole situation really messed with my head. ![was this really necessary](/assets/img/malingering.jpg)Broken promises self explanatory  I get it, the healthcare system is a mess and only getting worse. I'm not new to promises being broken in my life. But when it's my health it kind of stings more I guess. I'm ok with someone admitting not being able to deliver. But it can ruin my entire year or life if you set me up with the expectation and drop it. I have to schedule time off work and a ride to leave the city. And the person giving me a ride has to take time off work too. And then the bill I get that's hundreds possibly thousands of dollars. And I collapse daily to make that kind of money. I was referred to a large teaching hospital and was told on the first visit she's going to review my records and try to figure out a solution for me. I honestly worked my ass off saving money for months thinking \"she's working on my case\". How absolutely stupid and naive of me.  When I returned I realize she had done none of this and couldn't even ready my chart correctly. I noticed her web searching as we spoke which I don't mind but she landed on a page I had already read and was misinterpreting the article. I'm not sure how she would have reacted to me saying 'I read that' so I asked her if she was sure, and that I thought it was something else. She re-read the page and said oh yes, that's correct. She seemed too distracted eating a sandwhich and was in a rush for some reason.     After the appointment, I cried. I spent months pulling overtime for this, being so hopeful. Moments later I saw her leaving and going across the street to get another sandwhich. ProofI thought it was something I was doing wrong for a while until I realized this is just what happens when you have these symptoms and no answers. Got me a bit curious about why, with all their education, they can assume malice/laziness so confidently. I personally know the symptoms I have are debilitating and very real so how many others are they treating poorly? Apparently a lot. There’s also quite a few web forums particularly designed to follow patient’s social media pages and after reading over these for a long time I’ve noticed many are healthcare workers themselves. They laugh at and mock the patients even when they die. Constantly following them. Their discussions come up when you search for that patient’s alias. Even after their death they continue to follow the patient’s families and remark how much happier their family must be without them.Funny enough when HCWs get a condition like this themselves it goes one of two ways. It’s so mild that they can continue working and double down on their theories that the patients are drama queens, or if they have to quit working, the medical system turns against them.Another reason I’m not really getting much worked up anymore."
