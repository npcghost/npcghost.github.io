    "content": "      Introduction The vestibular system has traditionally been thought of as a balance apparatus that is related to brain disorders only when co-morbid symptoms include balance compromise, such as in Meniere′s disease and Parkinson′s disease. However, accumulating research suggests an association between vestibular function and psychiatric disorders, even when balance is apparently unaffected. Recent research has described the vestibular system as a potential window for exploring brain function beyond that of maintenance of balance, and into areas of perception, cognition, and consciousness (Lopez and Blanke, 2011). Existing research describes clear links between symptoms of anxiety and depression and the vestibular apparatus, and there is some preliminary evidence suggesting a link between the vestibular system and symptoms of psychosis and mania. Aspects of cognition, particularly spatial memory and spatial perception, have also been linked to vestibular function. The two key anatomical regions that provide links between the vestibular system and neural networks involved in cognitive and emotional processing are the parabrachial nucleus and the hippocampus (Balaban and Thayer, 2001, Balaban et al., 2002, Balaban, 2004a); however, many of the neuroanatomical regions that are linked to the vestibular system are also implicated in several psychiatric illnesses. The past decade has seen an increased interest in the relationship between the vestibular system and mood, cognition and psychiatric symptoms with studies demonstrating vestibular stimulation can produce changes in mood, cognition and psychiatric symptoms (Dodson, 2004, Levine et al., 2012, Winter et al., 2012). Hence, the time is now ripe to review the literature in an attempt to draw some overall conclusions. This review will firstly provide an overview of vestibular related brain structures that overlap with psychiatric disorders and then present a summary of how these regions of interest are implicated in prominent psychiatric disorder. The second section of the review will explore the cognitive and psychiatric symptoms that have been associated with vestibular (dys)function. Finally, we will bring these foci together to produce an overall summation of our current state of understanding of the relationship between vestibular function, psychiatric disorders, and cognition.        The vestibular system as a “Window to the Brain” for psychiatric symptomsThe vestibular system is vestigial and therefore intimately integrated into our central nervous system. Compromising a complex network of diverse pathways, there are vestibular origins within subcortical structures that traverse through the midbrain and then into the inner ear. With such diffuse connectivity, it is likely that vestibular function will be impacted upon at various stages of its pathways. Furthermore, it is comprised of both white matter and nerves, particularly the 8th cranial nerve (vestibulo-cochlear, which is a composite sensory nerve) hence vulnerable to different types of insults and/or compromised cell signalling. As illustrated in Fig. 1, neuroanatomical models of the vestibular system established through a variety of techniques including conventional and advanced structural MRI (e.g. T1-weighted and DTI), functional imaging (e.g. fMRI, magnetoencephalography (MEG)) and brain stimulation studies (e.g. galvanic or caloric vestibular stimulation; (Balaban and Jacob, 2001, Balaban et al., 2011, Bottini et al., 1994, Bottini et al., 1995, Bottini et al., 2001, Dieterich and Brandt, 2008, Emri et al., 2003, JA., 2004, Jones et al., 2009, Kisely et al., 2000, Kisely et al., 2002, Rochefort et al., 2013, Tuohimaa et al., 1983, Vitte et al., 1996, Wenzel et al., 1996) indicate that vestibular signals travel from the vestibular nuclei to brain stem nuclei, then project to subcortical structures, and regions well-known to be related to balance and muscle-coordination, such as the cerebellum, and those central to vision (specifically the occipital lobe) as well as direct and indirect projections to several cortical regions.  Whilst there is no direct evidence to suggest direct pathology of the vestibular apparatus in psychiatric disorders, there are many well identified links between the vestibular system and brain regions implicated in cognitive and emotion processing, which provide a potential neurological basis for the coexistence of vestibular and psychiatric symptoms (Balaban and Jacob, 2001, Yardley et al., 1999).Brainstem links to the vestibular systemIn terms of brainstem regions, the raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus are both implicated in several psychiatric conditions as well as having reciprocal connections with the vestibular nuclei. The raphe nuclei receives projections from the vestibular nuclei (Cuccurazzu and Halberstadt, 2008) and sends serotonergic and nonserotonergic projections to the vestibular nuclei (Halberstadt and Balaban, 2006, Kalen et al., 1985) as well as sending axon collaterals to the central amygdaloid nucleus, suggesting co-modulation of vestibular pathways with regions involved in affective control (Halberstadt and Balaban, 2006). The raphe-vestibular projections are organised into anatomically distinct fields which is thought to selectively modulate processing in regions of the vestibular nuclear complex that receive input from specific cerebellar zones, representing a potential mechanism whereby motor activity and behavioural arousal could influence the activity of cerebellovestibular circuits (Halberstadt and Balaban, 2003). The locus coeruleus provides noradrenergic innervation to the vestibular nuclei (Schuerger and Balaban, 1999), as well as collateral projections to regions including the cerebellum, neocortex and hypothalamus, which have been hypothesised to mediate effects of arousal on vestibular reflex performance. The locus coeruleus also responds to vestibular stimulation (Manzoni et al., 1989) via direct projections from the vestibular nuclei (Balaban, 1996) and input from vestibular related sources (Luppi et al., 1995).Limbic regions, parabrachial nucleus and the vestibular systemThe limbic system is central to both vestibular function and emotional processing. The parabrachial nucleus (PBN) network provides a direct link between the vestibular system and neural networks involved in emotional processing. The PBN has reciprocal connections with the vestibular nuclei (Balaban and Thayer, 2001, Balaban, 2002, Balaban, 2004b), as well as reciprocal connections with the amygdala, hypothalamus, locus coeruleus, and prefrontal cortex (Balaban and Thayer, 2001, Gorman et al., 2000, Schuerger and Balaban, 1999). The amygdala, hypothalamus, locus coeruleus and prefrontal cortex are all areas of the brain that are commonly linked with mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression (e.g. Bennett, 2011; Brown et al., 2011). The hippocampus is consistently implicated in cognition and models of psychiatric disorders and there is a large body of evidence supporting vestibular–hippocampal interactions (e.g. Besnard et al., 2012, Brandt et al., 2005, Hufner et al., 2007, Sharp et al., 1995, Smith et al., 2005a).Cortical connections to the vestibular systemThe exact locations and functions of cortical regions that process vestibular information remains unclear (zu Eulenburg et al., 2012). The anterior cingulate cortex has been considered part of the human vestibular cortex (Bottini et al., 1995, Bottini et al., 2001, Lopez and Blanke, 2011, Lopez et al., 2012), hence it has been conceptualised that the anterior cingulate cortex may provide a bridge between the vestibular sensorimotor areas and the affect divisions of the prefrontal regions that entail motivational states (Bush et al., 2000). The insular cortex is one of the main cortical regions that receives information from the vestibular nuclei in the brain stem (Akbarian et al., 1994). The prefrontal cortex regions indirectly, by way of motor association cortices and anterior cingulate cortex, exert regulatory influence over the vestibular sensory areas for attenuation of sensory stimulation (Carmona et al., 2009). The parietal cortex, particular the parietal opercular area has been implicated as a core cortical region for vestibular processing (zu Eulenburg et al., 2012).Neurochemical influences on the vestibular systemsIn addition to the neuroanatomical links, the vestibular system is implicated in both the serotonergic and dopaminergic systems, which are key neurotransmitter pathways involved in psychiatric disorders. Vestibular nucleus neurons respond to stimulation of the dorsal raphe nucleus (a key source of serotonergic input), as well as exogenous serotonin (Licata et al., 1995) and a rise in serotonin levels is observed in the medial vestibular nuclei following vestibular stimulation (i.e. caloric stimulation) (Halberstadt and Balaban, 2006). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are efficacious in the treatment of vertigo (Johnson, 1998) and SSRI withdrawal is associated with vestibular manifestations (i.e. dizziness) (Coupland et al., 1996). In relation to dopamine, dopamine (D2) receptors have been identified in neurons of the medial vestibular nucleus and the lateral vestibular nuclei (Smith, 2012, Smith and Darlington, 1994) and meaningful levels of dopamine have been detected in a region of the vestibular nuclei (Cransac et al., 1996). There is also evidence to suggest that dopamine might exert a modulatory action on the vestibular system, either by a direct action on the vestibular neurons or by modulation of GABAergic transmission (Vibert et al., 1995). In vestibular-compromised rats (following hemi-labyrinthectomy), treatment with a D2 agonist (bromocriptine) accelerates compensation of postural and ocular symptoms, whereas treatment with a D2 antagonist (sulpiride) slows down recovery, suggesting dopamine plays a role in the recovery from vestibular asymmetries (Petrosini and Dell′Anna, 1993).Vestibular related brain regions and psychiatric conditionsOn the basis of the mini-review above, 12 vestibular related brain regions (region of interest; ROI) known to be related to psychiatric conditions were selected: raphe nuclei, locus coreuleus, hippocampus, amygdala, insular cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, putamen, prefrontal cortex, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, and cerebellum. These ROIs were based upon a model of pathways involved in psychiatric and vestibular symptoms reviewed above. A MedLine search was conducted whereby imaging and electrophysiological peer-reviewed publications supporting the association of each ROI to a psychiatric condition were included. The psychiatric conditions included: Parkinson′s disease (PD), major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BPD), schizophrenia (SCZ), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) or obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It was not our intention to find every publication that matched our criteria, but rather, to reference a small collection of studies, meta-analyses or review papers (if available), to demonstrate that the relationship has been supported (Table 1)."

    "content": "I seem to already be predispositioned to issues with medications.  Especially to medications that use Cyp2c19 (A,A)High amount of studies + rare in N. America (common in Asia 30%?)Nonetheless I’ve been told to not put much weight in these studies from quite a few medical professionals so I suppose it’s all just my hypothetical ramblings.disclaimer: this is just one of many variants that could effect metabolism of medications that use cyp2c19.Medications I’ve triedYMMV . My current set of issues can influence how medications affect me much differently than someone with a different set of symptoms. Poor drug metabolism is also a factor here. I am also aware that some of these effects can be attributed to the ‘nocebo’ or ‘placebo’ effect, and they can even be influenced by what you ate that day. However, the side effects I experienced or assumed were so strong at times that I am wary about trying it again and have a fear of medications. Obviously I still tried as the list below shows. Also I’ve never had the ability to take more than a few days away from work so I often had to stop treatment if I couldn’t be bedridden for very long.  Benadryloccasionally very sick next day , flu like symptomsinfoMy Dr at the time had told me it's ok to use this nightly as a sleep aid but I eventually realized it was dramatically increasing my symptoms so I stoppped. MeclizineHave sublingual tabs that reduce about 20%, definitely not great for severe attacks, the pills don’t seem to be as effective eitherinfo These can work pretty fast and more efficiently than the pills     HydroxyzineThese do seem to make me drowsy, and reduce some anxiety, but it causes an increase in attacks if I take it too often.info It's technically an antihistamine but has anti anxiety properties for some patients. I actually took it briefly many years ago and it made me feel really weird. This time around I tried it again and it seemed to work better. 10mg is often all that's needed to get drowsy but during an attack I may take upwards of 50 to 75mg. I think 100 is the max but can still extend beyond that. For a while I was taking it all day during a bad attack (like 10mg every hour until I was calm again) and I think it was causing substantially increased rebound anxiety as it wore off. It does seem to dramatically reduce my blood pressure and heart rate. I already have issues with hypotension so lowering it more also may have been causing increased anxiety. I would usually sleep on it, but the after effects still had that vital lowering effect for a whole day after.  DimenhydrinateMild sedative even in larger doses for me, increases symptomsinfo These are often sold as dramamine. I always got carsick so that mixed with my autonomic issues at the time made long trips terrible. I decided to keep it on me during a recent trip just in case. 5hr car ride, -10f, little sleep and we made it to the hotel. I took an elevator up 8 floors to my room. The elevator sensation never stopped for me. Constant falling sensation. I took a dramamine, tried to ignore it, and went back down the elevator to have dinner. Middle of dinner I felt like I was going to faint. Tried to escape but didn't make it and fainted in front of the entire restaurant. Caused a scene since I went into convulsions. EMT called. Spent rest of my vacation in my room vomiting. Thank you dramamine.    Theoretically now I assume my blood pressure was low and it dropped it even lower making me highly susceptible to fainting. I was still quite new to my issues at the time.  Doxylamine succinateEffective sleeping medicine, fast tolerance, mild hangover effectinfo I notice these are one of the few otc sleeping pills I can somewhat handle. I noticed this when I realized I could handle nyquil fine and this is a main ingredient. It seems like unisom is the main manufacturer of this. I prefer to have a liquid version since I don't like taking even a small amount more than I should, just enough to drift to sleep. I don't know what the long term consequences are of these in particular. Cholinergics theoretically linked to dementia. But I also know without sleep, I lose my job and my mind.    BetahistineIncreased GI issues, mild relief of vertigoinfo This was suggested to me by others with similar issues. It appears to be commonly prescribed in other countries for vertigo but not approved in the states. I took other totally very legal means of acquiring this to try it.   I started with half a dose but it didn't seem to do anything so gradually increased to full dose. It did seem to almost dull the sensation of vertigo a bit. Like it was holding the middle ear down with static. But just barely and the GI symptoms I had from it didn't go away with time. It also can counteract some antihistamines which I rely on occasionally so it was not worth it to me.  OndansetronCauses a headache, but effective anti nausea med.info  AcetaminophenNo obvious side effects, but also very low efficacyinfo Since this is low efficacy and it's rare for me to have a fever, I usually don't take this very often. Alternative if you have issues with NSAIDs so I'm trying to not ruin my gut on NSAIDs to begin with so I don't have only this to rely on. IbuprofenGI issues if too often, but effective pain reliefinfo This is actually pretty decent for pain in most cases, although I've had it not come through for me in rare moments. Caution does need to be exercised with this, however, as it reduces the mucus you generate in your stomach, hence the advice to eat with it. I do my best to stay at 200mg, only taking it if my pain is so bad that I can't work, sleep, or am fainting... and not more than a few days in a row. Rebound occurs anyway      NaproxenTried for cramps, headaches, muscle aches. Doesn’t work?info I honestly haven't figured out what this even helps with so far. It's another NSAID too so definitely not worth it for me. CBDOccasionally works for pain and anxiety, but often not at all.info THC increases my vertigo (sad days) but it seems like a little bit is needed for CBD to be more pronounced. Still seems too low at the federal limit anyways. I've tried various reputable oils and balms. Very hit or miss. I wonder if I just don't metabolize it most of the time. Sometimes it works great. Since there's practically no issues with safety I always give it a shot to see if it will work for something mild. PropranololMade my BP crash; caused more anxietyinfo I already have issues with low BP so this wasn't a good mix. I went in prepared for that though so maybe I was setting myself up to fail. I even tried it for performance anxiety. It's supposed to stop all your physical symptoms. It kind of did... but not mentally, then I fainted. TopamaxDaily panic attacks first week, was told to stop itinfo I really wanted this to work. At the time I was desparate and just wanted something to work. I was in a state of constant high anxiety and panic. I would just sit on the floor shaking, sweating, delerious. and my boyfriend at the time told me I probably should stop them but I was determined to \"get used to it\". I called my new Dr at the time and he told me to stop them. Since I felt so awful it was hard to argue with that but I wonder why he would tell me to stop over something like that when my last doctor got mad that I wanted to stop over sudden paralysis? Wild ProgesteroneCream and pill ; dramatically increased vertigo, couldn’t stick with itinfo Really wanted this to work. Severe attacks almost always have occured during hormonal shifts within my cycle. I couldn't handle it anymore. Even the smallest spike sent me into a cluster of attacks. Maybe I'll try this when I'm a bit older as hormonal balances change often.  DepoBled for 8 months straight, increase in all symptoms, almost lost jobinfo I remember long ago getting on this hoping it would stop my period but instead it made me sick for months and my period never stopped. I called the office about this and they told me 'just give it more time'. I didn't continue the series as I would have been homeless without an income. If it got any worse I would have had to stop working.    AzithromycinTemporarily stopped all symptoms for 2 weeks, gradual return to baselineinfo I was actually pretty nervous to take this but within 3hrs all of my symptoms disappeared. It stayed like this until 2 weeks after the last dose. One of the first 'this can't be a placebo' moments I've ever had because it was like a heavy fog had lifted from me and I had never felt that clear headed since before I got sick.  I've told multiple doctors about this and most just give it the eyebrow raise and continue with stanadard treatment layout.  I was given another round by my pcp however but it wasn't as effective I assume since it was less than a year from my last dose. Also would like to avoid constant abx use for obvious reasons.  CiproIntense joint pains and increased feverinfo This was a long time ago so it's hard to accurately document what happened. Back when I used to just take what's given to me without hesitation or question. I remember not being able to finish it and it costing me more days from work as it made me even more sick and immobile with joint pain. I probably should have finished it, I remember I had like 2 left and really needed to get back to work.   MetronidazoleKept throwing up the pills, high amounts of abdominal paininfo Little embarrassed about why I had to take this but what it was resolving just wasn't worth the pain. Made all my symptoms worse. EscitalopramSudden complete paralysis and intense fear, stomach problems, fever, sweating, diarhhea, tremblinginfo This was  the worst reaction I've ever had to any substance ever. I'm not convinced this was nocebo at all in the slightest. This was a gradual worsening until the attack. I'm not sure why. Either it's because I can't excrete it and it builds up then releases in my blood stream all at once.. or it caused my already low electrolytes to bottom out. Dr at the time was upset I didn't want to continue.   AmitryptilineCan’t handle doses over 25mg but will hit tolerance and just have to stop, helps sleep and appetite,info I was actually on this for a long time. The side effects were mild and some actually beneficial. It did nothing for my vertigo and slightly even increased positional tachycardia but I was sleeping 12hrs a day, barely awake when I was up, and eating more. Before I started it, I was sleep deprived and having issues keeping food down. I also liked not being conscious.. a lot. I remember I was not doing a good job at work and didn't even care. I hit tolerance but started getting headaches if I increased my dose past 25mg. So I had to stop them. Might return someday since tolerance is reset. It's a good medication to kind of stop me from losing my mind. AlbuterolNo issues. I don’t use this unless I feel like I’m dyinginfo After a respiratory illness I was having issues waking up feeling like my diaphragm was paralyzed and not being able to take a breath for a minute before finally catching my breath. I was told to try PPIs even though I felt no heartburn. I requested an inhaler should it happen again and it did help a bit. I only use it during respriratory infections now. OmeprazoleBack pain, increased abdominal issuesinfo I tried these for a bit but they didn't help my shortness of breath attacks much plus added new problems.  HydrocodoneEffective pain reliever, only used onceinfo I forgot when I last tried this but remember it working really well. I've also had oxy and much prefer this instead. CodeineEffective pain reliever, haven’t tried since childhoodinfo Still better than oxy OxycontinCauses vertigo to increase, motion sickness, mild pain reliefinfo add textTramadolVery sick - fever, sweatinginfo Forgot when I tried this also, was before I started logging things so at least a few decades. Piracetamyes I mean piracetam and not paracetamol. Debilitating long brain zapsinfo Was kind of winging experimental medications when I first got sick and thought this would help my fatigue and brain fog. It didn't seem to do anything beneficial and started giving me very long brain zaps. I still remember one that lasted 10 minutes straight. I thought I was going to drift into a seizure.  MagnesiumMild side effects, causes headaches, effective laxativeinfo tried a variation of these. Citrate, glycinate, threonate.. all seem to just give me a headache. It's a bit calming and of course laxative effects but overall not worth it. I've never tested my mag levels and not sure if that's even an accurate test but I wonder if I possibly have.. too much? Tanganilno side effects, unsure if useful &lt;summary&gt;info&lt;/summary&gt; This also doesn’t appear to be available in the states so I got this from very legal means as well. No side effects, but not effects of any kind either. It’s supposed to help both hypotensions and central vertigo/balance issues so I was really hoping this would be a match. ProchlorperazineIncreased anxietyinfo I only took this once but it seemed to speed my heart up and caused my adrenaline system to spike. Could this have just been anxiety? Hard to tell.. scared to try it again but maybe I should. coq10heart palpitationsinfo increased palpitations when I took them hoping to reduce them. Not sure what it would do now that I'm not having constant palp issues. Famotidinehelps tachycardia and air hungerinfo Seems to greatly benefit shortness of breath and overall that flushed/adrenaline feeling. Realized later this often is used for mcas symptoms https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8021898/Also apparentlly a lot of people with ALDH2 deficiencies take this to avoid skin flushing with alcohol. ProbioticsDidn’t work at first but then relieved a post viral gi issues I acquired. Certain kinds cause headaches.info Early 2023 I was down with a virus of some sort. When I recovered I had.. some really interesting/embarrassing gi issues that kept me confined near a bathroom at all times. This didn't stop for a month and I ordered visbiome. Within 3 days I regained control of everything. Not only that but after a few weeks my gi issues were better than before I started it. When I try to taper down it returns however.  l theaninegood for jitters, often combined with coffee. Doesn’t seem to help vertigo muchinfo add textNACCaused shortness of breath, may try again with molybdenum since the air hunger could be a result of sulfur buildup.LDNheadaches, fatigueinfo Seemed promising, especially with my recent antibotic response. High safety profile, tons of people improving on it. Its use in areas outside of addiction is still novel and I wasn't sure if I could get a dr to agree to such an odd thing. I found out ageless rx offers it with barely a consult so I went with them. There are other totally legal methods too. I also completely forgot I have friends that are always in rehab and they all have a ton they probably don't take. Somehow got on to my medical record that I take this. I don't like that because many HCW may take this the wrong way and think I've been in addiction treatment.   If you are using the 50mg pills you can dissolve in distilled water in a ratio that's easy to section into the dosages you need then just do a stir of it before taking it daily. I started at .25 then gradually moved to 1mg a day but for months my headaches, myalgia, fatigue just got worse. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6313374/PhenibutThis was supposed to help vertigo and social anxiety, but it made everything so much worse.info I've always noted to take special caution with any medications directly targeting gaba/dopamine. This is such a controversial drug. Unregulated gaba type drug from Russia. High potential for abuse and addiction occurs faster than Benzodiazepines. Similar withdrawals. Technically still legal but its poor reputation has caused most vendors to stop selling it. I think I got mine from liftmode recently which has had QC issues but there's not really a better vendor it seems.  MidodrineFelt tingly but didn’t seem to mess with my BP or heart rate by much. It works for like 30min and I can do chores without getting lightheaded, then for 4hrs I feel worse than before I took it.info Supposed to help with hypotension. LorazepamI don’t “feel” anything. When I confront something that causes vertigo or panic, it seems to stop it? Perhaps I need to do a test and have someone give me a real one and then a sugar pill occasionally and then chart my results. I also realize delusions of sobriety is a thing with this but I doubt I would ever reach that on such low doses. I do have issues standing at a counter 100% of the time and it was so incredible to stand there without any PPPD.I already am fully aware of the consequences the come with daily use. This is just a rescue med for me.More details Took a lot out of me to ask for this and I am now scared to ask for more. All my previous doctors didn't seem to want to prescribe it. My attacks can be back to back and last all day. To a point I can't move or have to crawl. There seems to be very high success with this drug stopping that. It would not only stop the attack but prevent them from being disabled for weeks later since the length of the attack affects recovery. I'd say upwards of 90% of patients were able to escape terrible consequences of vertigo attacks with this. The vestibular patients really encouraged I try to get this. And that yes I risk being labeled as drug seeking unfortunately.       It was really upsetting to me that many were just denied this. That you can lose your job, your house, your family, everything all because no one wanted to trust you with a particular medication.   That being said, I am so grateful my Dr trusts me with this. "

    "content": "I know these are shit diagnoses. I haven’t found an objective answer so I get trash labels slapped on me.Vasovagal SyncopeDiagnosed when I kept fainting. I always thought this condition was fainting over a common fear trigger like sight of blood, needles, etc. When faced with a fear I do not pass out. These events happened spontaniously. Sometimes after a meal, temp changes, infections, digestive issues. These were pretty intense to me as I'd feel overwhelming pain and eventually my legs would go paralyzed, I'd go deaf and blind,... sometimes crawling around while losing consciousness over and over again. I'd go into convulsions while passed out. A few times others said my lips and eyelids turned blue. I suppose that still puts me in the same category as fainting over the sight of blood. Perhaps the mechanism is the same but I hated never knowing why mine were so particularly bad. Why I could handle substantial pain externally but not internall.    DepressionThey gave me this required survey thing with questionnaires that didn't make much sense to me since a lot of the answers could be misconstrued with being ill. Like not socializing much, having little energy. But I suppose that led to my depression diagnosis. Ha GADI will admit that ever since I got sick I've been constantly in a state of worry and fear. My mind automatically equates being vulnereable to being open for abuse. Also it's uncomfortable to think about how you're supposed to survive the rest of your life sick.Vestibular Migraines VM Summary     This was an odd one. I started getting vertigo attacks years after my autonomic issues. These things are the most debilitating and horrifying attacks ever to me. On my worst attack, I couldn't move for 20hrs and for another 15hrs I was crawling and bedridden. The room wouldn't stop spinning and I \"blacked out\" psychologically several times from being so overwhelmed. Yeah that also means laying in your own excrements...    After this I had several similar but shorter attacks. Ruled out BPPV. They diagnosed me with menieres but retracted it when my hearing came back fine. I wanted to try the steroid shots so I was bummed that I'd have to prove meniere's before being able to try this. Eventually the diagnosis of Vestibular Migraines was reached. I haven't had a 30+hr attack but will often still have the hour long ones. Whatever anyone wants to call it, they are the worst thing in my life right now. Panic AttacksI was just starting to get my fainting under control when the vertigo started. I lost my mind over this. I started getting panic attacks. I have some times in my life where these are controlled but as of lately they've returned pretty badly. They are back to back also.  POTSThis was diagnosed kind of late for me. I actually mentioned this over a decade ago to a doctor about my syncope issues and was told it's too rare so I dropped it. I feel like it's more under control now but I think maybe my dr just wanted to be able to open the ability for me to try a particular medication that could help my low blood pressure. CFSThis one is pretty common now too I suppose. I have moments where I can barely keep myself upright. I feel sick - like I've been poisoned and it's caused me to collapse from weakness countless times. Quite alarming when it happens, like your body is just shutting down from being poisoned. It does seem to occur when I've exercised too hard or have 'done too much'. Usually occurs the following days after the events. There's a type of fatigue you feel while sick with the virus I can try to equate this to. Some months I'll get a break from it and other months, it's like every damn day.  I have somewhat significant GI issues I also haven’t investigated yet. They’re debilitating and kind of tie in with the whole POTS/CFS/dysautonomia BS I suppose. Yet I feel like I will just be trading thousands of dollars for another dead end answer. I’ll have to wait until I have better insurance, the symptoms are less vague, or I end up underweight from it."

This is a controversial treatment for autonomic issues but I wanted to at least try it and see how much of a difference it would make.At first I couldn’t even get an appointment in until a week after trying and then it was canceled and postponed another two days by them so trying to get it set up for the height of symptoms or prevention seemed to not be in my favor.I also had requested the package that contains pms and illness alleviation as I was recovering from a viral infection and still feeling like shit. I think it had extra magnesium and anti-inflammatories. Unfortunately they just gave me a standard myers cocktail. Perhaps if this all had been done correctly I may have experienced relief. I was a bit nervous about large amounts of NSAIDs however and its effects on my GI system so I suppose it could have gone south anyways.Unfortunately nothing much was felt besides increased hydration. I even woke up with a headache the next day.I hope to possibly use them in the event of an intense painful migraine attack as they have toradol and zofran, but if it takes them over a week to get to me I see no point. Maybe I could have someone drive me there."

    "content": "Initial testingIn 2018, I had originally had my first vestibular tests and VRT recommendations. At the time I had put this off due to financial issues. I realized I could just do these at home so what sense would it make to pay thousands of dollars when I could use that money for a second opinion or further investigation?Vestibular TherapyMany years went by and I had some extra health surprises along the way that postponed this including the pandemic, but I eventually returned to them in 2021 when my vestibular system got worse again after the covid vaccine. It was early release so I was not under any regulatory pressure to have taken it, and didn’t assume it would do more than put me out for a few days. Unfortunately it threw me into a flare so intense that I was considering a wheelchair or rollator.There was a lot of controversy surrounding this at the time so I remained quiet and just told healthcare workers it must have been from covid because I was so weak and sick that I didn’t have the strength for others to make this a political issue.Despite this, the first thing the vestibular therapist asked me was if I recentlly had the vaccine and I admitted I had. She did mention that this seemed to be a common theme with them. https://vestibular.org/forum/dizziness/covid-19-vaccine-side-effects/Regardless, we dropped the subject and continued with treatment.I was scheduled to be there 2 days a week. I was unable to drive the distance to this area. It was in an adjoined city. So taking an uber/lyft would get me there but I’d have no way of getting home because the starting destination had no drivers. And perhaps I’m just not understanding things socially but I didn’t have anyone available to be there for me 2x a week and assumed this was a normal problem for others but the workers seemed to be frustrated with me on this topic. Nonetheless I discovered that I could use paratransit if my PT cooperated with the paperwork which she did. Why didn’t she suggest this in the first place? Again… maybe I truly am so isolated that I saw the prospect of having someone there for me at all times as incredulous.The exercises always temporarily corrected my balance disorder but the next large vertigo attack would set me back. As I’ve always known this to be an issue and explained it to them. They had to see it for themselves and also came to the conclusion in the end that until my vertigo attacks stop, the balance correction will always be set back.My insurance barely covered this so I ended up paying quite a bit for the sessions in the end. Theoretically I did this because I knew I had to prove that I tried it should I ever need less commonly covered treatments in the future such as botox or CGRPs, etc.."

    "content": "I have trust issues with healthcare workers due to negative experiences despite my efforts to cooperate. I sought a psychologist for insight, but can’t continue due to cost. People do think I’m apathetic, which might influence healthcare workers negatively, though it’s unreasonable to expect perfect cheerfulness when I’m ill. Their poor judgements have costed me financially and could negatively effect my care, especially since my medical conditions are hard to prove.I currently don’t drink or smoke. Exercise regularly. Normal BMI. Maybe when they run out of things to blame, they default to judging your character. &lt;/i&gt;Disbelief of side effectsAn event where I was told to keep taking something that harmed me  I used to disregard mild side effects, thinking they might be from something else or a placebo effect. But there were instances when it was unmistakable, like with Lexapro. After a few days on it, I experienced constant shaking, sickness, and strange sensations. My sleep patterns were erratic; I'd either fall asleep instantly or feel like I'd been awake all day upon waking.I called my doctor's office, and they assured me these initial symptoms were normal, suggesting I take the prescribed hydroxyzine alongside it. Trusting my doctor, I tried to ignore the symptoms. However, on the seventh day, I woke up, got ready for work, and suddenly felt a shock up my spine. I lost sensation in my limbs, collapsed, and experienced total paralysis with no breathing or heartbeat. It was a terrifying experience, and I couldn't even scream. After a minute, I regained feeling and hyperventilated.My boyfriend at the time couldn't help due to work, and I called my doctor's office, who advised me to come in without driving. They found elevated vitals and nystagmus but didn't see anything requiring an ER visit. Strangely, my doctor insisted I continue the medication and claimed it was just a placebo in the first month. His reaction left a lasting fear of medication, as I worry there won't be help if something goes wrong. I should have changed doctors, but I hesitated due to the time invested with him and self-doubt about my actions during this incident.Also he had agreed to do further testing as I felt something was very wrong.  Malingering Accusations  Being accused of faking I keep my medical records for accurate reference due to my cognitive and memory issues, relying on OCR technology for recall. When I requested records from my physical therapist (PT), I noticed they mentioned my absence between my initial evaluation and the start of therapy, suggesting I might be malingering. They also questioned the validity of my condition, noting that I briefly stood still while they applied straps and then continued to wobble.  I could have explained the reasons behind these actions (e.g., delays due to financial issues, surgery, the pandemic, and transportation challenges). Additionally, my blood pressure issue affects my vestibular system, so calf tightening briefly stabilizes me but worsens it when released. Ironically, But they assumed and documented without asking. I worry that future physicians might side with the PT, dismissing my case due to this written statement.  I didn't know how to resolve this at the time. Consulting with a psychologist and others, I received mixed advice. Some suggested filing a complaint and correcting it, while others believed the correction might draw more attention and considered it just an opinion. Given the small city and potential system backlash, I hesitated.   I've been warned that this incident could harm future attempts at Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) if I become unable to work due to my condition. This casual approach by my PT, especially after I confided in them about the importance of keeping myself employed as I could end up homeless, has left me feeling betrayed. There appeared to be no turmoil between us and she was quite pleasant. The whole situation really messed with my head. Broken promises self explanatory  I get it, the healthcare system is a mess and only getting worse. I'm not new to promises being broken in my life. But when it's my health it kind of stings more I guess. I'm ok with someone admitting not being able to deliver. But it can ruin my entire year or life if you set me up with the expectation and drop it. I have to schedule time off work and a ride to leave the city. And the person giving me a ride has to take time off work too. And then the bill I get that's hundreds possibly thousands of dollars. And I collapse daily to make that kind of money. I was referred to a large teaching hospital and was told on the first visit she's going to review my records and try to figure out a solution for me. I honestly worked my ass off saving money for months thinking \"she's working on my case\". How absolutely stupid and naive of me.  When I returned I realize she had done none of this and couldn't even ready my chart correctly. I noticed her web searching as we spoke which I don't mind but she landed on a page I had already read and was misinterpreting the article. I'm not sure how she would have reacted to me saying 'I read that' so I asked her if she was sure, and that I thought it was something else. She re-read the page and said oh yes, that's correct. She seemed too distracted eating a sandwhich and was in a rush for some reason.     After the appointment, I cried. I spent months pulling overtime for this, being so hopeful. Moments later I saw her leaving and going across the street to get another sandwhich. Proofscreenshots from online forumsI thought it was something I was doing wrong for a while until I realized this is just what happens when you have these symptoms and no answers.   Got me a bit curious about why, with all their education, they can assume malice/laziness so confidently. I personally know the symptoms I have are debilitating and very real so how many others are they treating poorly? Apparently a lot.    There's also quite a few web forums particularly designed to follow patient's social media pages and after reading over these for a long time I've noticed many are healthcare workers themselves. They laugh at and mock the patients even when they die. Constantly following them. Their discussions come up when you search for that patient's alias. Even after their death they continue to follow the patient's families and remark how much happier their family must be without them.  Funny enough when HCWs get a condition like this themselves it goes one of two ways. It's so mild that they can continue working and double down on their theories that the patients are drama queens, or if they have to quit working, the medical system turns against them. Another reason I'm not really getting much worked up anymore. "

    "content": "It’s hard to identify the causes. At one point I had no issues driving to work, working long hours, being active, socializing, functioning on low sleep and caffeine. I had little to no anxiety and could take risks/be on stage. Then suddenly I started feeling more “off” after a particularly bad infection. Until the day I pushed myself too hard and my body just … shut down. Ever since then I’ve been unwell with a myriad of physiologic and psychologic symptoms.Viral/BacterialMaybe at some point in 2009 I got sick. I usually catch something every year so this wasn’t alarming for me in any way. I remember this being particularly bad however. I was pissing and coughing up blood. I had no insurance at the time which wasn’t uncommon for my specific situation (young 20s, no parents, recession). At some point I went to an urgent care and quick clinic. I do remember being prescribed Cipro, and getting upset I wasn’t warned about how intense the symptoms would be. I didn’t take my last few doses either. One way or another I recovered but never bounced back to my usual self and had residual symptoms that I brushed off. I tried to obtain my medical records from this time but they said they didn’t exist. I later found out that may have been a lie since my dr many many years later confirmed I had been there at that time.I think it was a kidney infection and strep together somehow. I don’t think I remember or was told what the actual infection was. Again, I thought I’d just eventually get over it.Also strange thing that has happened was a temporary resolution of all symptoms while on azithromycin.EnvironmentalI was living in pretty trashy conditions. I didn’t care about diseases. I mean,… all of my friends were living this way, some even worse, and they were all fine. There was mold in my apartment. Mouse infestations. Terrible diet choices. I lived on little sleep and cheap food. This was also a problem for me for a while as a kid also since my parents struggled with money for a while until I was a bit older. I had been homeless several times then and briefly past 18. Slept outside multiple times, occasionally in the middle of winter and remember getting quite sick over it.Still .. I had started to improve my living conditions and career one step at a time. Especailly after that viral infection that took me down, I realized I needed to step up a bit with my overall health choices.Also wonder if the climate of this area has anything to do with it. I’ve never tried living elsewhere.GeneticsThis is all still such a new field. I did end up pulling my raw data from a consumer dna kit into an aggregator that links health similarities of the carriers to certain SNPs. Still just theoretical but many held heavy weight with tons of accredited studies.The top confident findings indicated poor drug metabolism. A lot of cardiac issues. Nothing that stuck out as completely suggestive of a predisposed weakness that could have caused this all to happen.My family health history was also a mess but nothing too solid genetically. The usual just overall shit genes situation. Cancers, heart disease, diabetes, depression, anxiety, stupidity, etc.I seem to be predisposed to hypertension in particular which is curious to me, as I struggle with hypotension.PyschologicalThis is an uncomfortable topic of causataion for me and many others. And since it’s a spectrum that cannot be objectively measured, it leaves a lot to be debated.There’s no doubt I may have psychiatric conditions weighing as a possible trigger. Both genetic and past socioeconomic struggles and ACE factors definitely put me at risk.My first therapist mentioned the possibility of my sympathetic nervous sytem being compromised and allowing illnesses that most would brush off to be overwhelming for me. I also am convinced this lowers immunity and leaves you more susceptible to actual physical damage to diseases. Damage that we just can’t objectively measure yet.I also did eventually see a psychologist. He was nice and empathetic but I don’t think much was discovered out of the limited sessions I could afford. It also seemed like he didn’t quite understand why I was there in the first place.  Overall I was just trying to see if a professional could tease out if I truly am having all of these issues due to a psychological standpoint but he seemed to be convinced mine were physical while my therapist before him was convinced it was psychological."

    "content": "Currently I work from home. This is still challenging as I will have symptoms that cause me to suddenly lose my ability to function at all. Usually once one attack hits, I feel incredibly sick for a while and it either slowly gets better or I keep getting more attacks. I tried to ask my job if I could be off the phones but the background tasks are often too challenging also.   I don’t get a full days work in much anymore. I get told I need to find work but I usually can’t do most of it so I spend time looking and not getting paid until I find something. Even recently had someone call me lazy when I was in the middle of throwing up/barely conscious which caused me to pull back even more. It’s honestly so defeating.I wish I had a good answer on how to change my situation without there being a huge risk of setting myself up for poverty and homelessness.      Financial -  I’m already pushing myself until I collapse and still poor. Imagine starting another job when you’re already prone to missing 3 or more days a month minimum. You usually have to have good standing for a while before benefits are attainable like fmla. Highly prone to getting fired in the first year when you mess up like that.        Medical Costs - I have high premiums high deductible and the price increases every year with age. There’s also very little coverage on visits, surgeries, tests, procedures. I tried to see if there were better options on the marketplace but it shows it will only match my employer. I think there’s a community health center here but their doctors don’t like patients like me because I’m not an easy case.        Little Medical Support - I haven’t had very solid proof. Clinically they’ve caught some things like nystagmus, low blood pressure, but that’s not really enough to convince anyone. Therefore I have little support from Drs. They typically look down on my diagnoses anyways. Even had one recently note that I was faking so that won’t look good if I ever need to exchange records for assistance. I also lost most of my connections. It’s a common thing to become isolated when sick. Especially if all you can manage is work and rest.        Transportation Due to the nature of my issue, travel of any sort is incredibly difficult. I can’t drive anymore and just being a passenger can leave me sick for days. It’s like motion sickness x100 with fainting, delerious with symptoms, etc. I also have to ask someone to take me to other cities and that means we both need to request PTO for that day since specialists aren’t exactly “come in when it’s convenient for you”. They also can cancel on you at any time. This city is somewhat limited on medical resources. No independent labs so I can’t just telehealth and get what’s recommended. Very few or no specialized doctors or clinics for certain things like autonomic issues.        Stubbornness This one I should probably work on but it’s really difficult to beg for help and be a burden on others. Asking for help leaves you open for others to criticize you. Call you lazy, a beggar, leech, etc. It’s also hard for me to maintain friendships. Imagine always causing a scene, especially if it’s someone’s big day. Many get so frustrated with you over it and think you can somehow control it, some think you are attention seeking. I’d rather just die tbh.  "
