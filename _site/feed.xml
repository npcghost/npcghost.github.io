High amount of studies + rare in N. America (common in Asia 30%?)

Diagnosed when I kept fainting. I always thought this condition was fainging over a common fear trigger like sight of blood, needles, etc. When faced with a fear I do not pass out. These events happened spontaniously. Sometimes after a meal, temp changes, infections, dige...
