      Dysbiosis May Be the Root Cause

Initial Onset

  My health issues began after a severe flu, leading to chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS).
  Viruses are known to disrupt gut bacteria, and I suspected my microbiome might play a role in my symptoms.

      Acquired a CGM - Stelo


They seemed to have designed this to not alert for hypoglycemia or show levels below 70. I had to obtain a secondary app called Dexcom Clarity so I could see the raw data which doesn’t appear immediately.
Apparently it’s considered a medical event that is to be handled by a dr if it falls below 70 so they can’t show/alert.

I’d like to get one that alerts hypoglycemia b...

      I’d like to rule out the following but have a feeling it is nearly impossible due to:


  
    Human error. Many of these tests are sensitive, meaning there's a higher likelihood of data mistenterpretation/human error than there is of an actual correct workflow of actions from person a through z.

      As of 5/2/24 I have reduced POTS, PPPD, and IBS. 

Vertigo attacks are still to date the most intense thing I think I will ever experience. 
Once I was able to quell severe attacks with ativan, I no longer feared them in the same way.

I also got a head start on things as I had fallen ill with a gastrointestinal illness and I was having issues with it not being eradicated. I was basically barel...

The vestibular system has traditionally been thought of as a balance apparatus that is related to brain disorders only when co-morbid symptoms include balance compromise, such as in Meniere′s disease and Parkinson′s disease. However, accumulating research suggests an association between vestibular function and psychiatric disorders, even when balance is apparently unaffect...
