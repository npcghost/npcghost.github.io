    Introduction 
The vestibular system has traditionally been thought of as a balance apparatus that is related to brain disorders only when co-morbid symptoms include balance compromise, such as in Meniere′s disease and Parkinson′s disease. However, accumulating research suggests an association between vestibular function and psychiatric disorders, even when balance is apparently unaffect...
